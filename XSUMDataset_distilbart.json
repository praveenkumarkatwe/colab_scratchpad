    "input": "Alex McKechnie, then 16, was in the crowd for that first show and went on to be a regular at the club I saw The Beatles a few times in the north end of Liverpool and was working in Liverpool city centre as a messenger boy in a printing works when I heard that they were on at the Cavern in a lunchtime session. The Cavern was in the basement of a three or four storey warehouse. The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches. At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times. I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting than the previous gigs because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there. The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them. They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them. I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool. The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were by Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff. As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous. It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage. They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern. They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose. That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them. Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work. Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again. They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them. They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal. I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me. Alex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs. The Cavern is celebrating the anniversary with a series of tribute events on Wednesday. A documentary about the first gig will be broadcast on ITV1 at 2240 GMT on Wednesday.",

    "input": "Just days after dropping a supreme court action, the twins filed a fresh lawsuit against the company. It claims that Facebook intentionally or inadvertently suppressed evidence during their previous litigation. Originally, Tyler and Cameron accused Mr Zuckerberg of stealing their idea to create the site. The story of the feud formed the core of the 2010 film The Social Network. The row dates from 2003 when the Winklevosses hired Mr Zuckerberg to write code for their ConnectU site while at Harvard. He never did, but instead set up Facebook, which quickly became a success around the world. A court case over who did what was resolved in 2008 when the parties agreed on a financial settlement, reportedly worth around 65m Â41m. In January 2011 the Winklevosses tried to reopen the case, seeking more money. However, a US appeals court ruled in April that they would have to accept the settlement. The twins initially said they would appeal against the settlement, but decided this week not to pursue that legal avenue. In the most recent suit filed on Thursday with the US District Court of Massachusetts, the Winklevosses and their business partner Divya Narendra said that Facebook hid some crucial information from them during settlement proceedings. The twins said that Mr Zuckerberg did not disclose some important documents in regards to the relationship between him and the brothers while they were at Harvard. Facebook's outside counsel Neel Chatterjee said in a statement These are old and baseless allegations that have been considered and rejected previously by the courts.",

    "input": "It is believed to be the first alleged breach of the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures TPim. The suspect appeared at the Old Bailey accused of failing to contact a monitoring company and report to a police station twice in January. The Home Office has refused to comment on the case. TPims replaced control orders in January 2012. The suspect - who can only be referred to as BM - was one of nine British citizens subject to a TPim when the figures were last disclosed in March. The BBC is not aware of anyone else who has appeared in court charged with a breach of a TPim. The Home Office said We do not comment on individual cases. The police investigate all breaches of TPims and will prosecute where that is viable. Those subject to a TPim can be ordered to stay overnight at a specified address and report to a police station every day. Other measures include a ban on contacting particular individuals, going to certain areas and places and travelling abroad. Labour has argued that TPims have weakened public protection against terrorism. In March, the independent reviewer of terror laws, David Anderson, said TPims could prove less effective than control orders because they can be imposed for a maximum period of two years only. The court heard that BM is charged with two counts of breaching Section 23 of a TPim order. The allegations are that on 16 January he failed to contact a monitoring company, and on 27 January failed to report to a police station. BM, who has a grey beard and was dressed for the hearing in a white shirt, cannot be named nor have his address published for legal reasons. The prosecutor Louise Gray asked for a provisional date of 2 July to be set for a plea and case management hearing. The defendant was granted unconditional bail although he remains subject to the restrictions imposed by his TPim. A trial date was not set.",

    "input": "Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region. For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration. Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame. A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught. To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over. But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore. The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma. Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism. Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime. He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship. His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised lowlanders in Oromia and Ogadenia. His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order. Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring. The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele. But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty. The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed work in progress, has long stalled. Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents. Why West will miss Meles Obituary Meles Zenawi Life in pictures Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time. Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct regime survival. He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front EPRDF and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents. His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising. That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus. The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up. Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically. He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums. He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable. Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse. From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought. Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called new breed of African leaders. The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests. He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to tame a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991. The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea. Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border. It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension. That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond. In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia. The death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia. There are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview. Such fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility. However, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.",

    "input": "Did you set this up? Salford City Reds owner Dr Marwan Koukash asked, at the start of the station's rugby league hour this week. The extravagant millionaire has grabbed the ailing Reds by the scruff of the neck and set about building a dream in arguably the sport's most crucial year. Having ruffled feathers with his breathtakingly bold bids to sign Sam Tomkins and Adrian Morley, Koukash has promised to make the Super League strugglers the biggest rugby club in the country within three to four years. What he has definitely done is make people talk about Salford again. Far from being a prickly atmosphere in the studio, there appeared to be real warmth between the extrovert racehorse owner, the man he wants to coach his club - Brian Noble, and the rugby league legend he wants to sign from Warrington - Adrian Morley. The more Marwan's the merrier, the better, said Noble, the former Great Britain and Bradford Bulls coach still waiting for the right opportunity to return to the sport. You just need passionate people with some substance behind them to push the game forward. His passion fills you with enthusiasm, you want to get going and get cracking. Those comments will have been music to the ears of the fiercely ambitious Koukash, who learned the art of hard work during three years in a refugee camp in Jordan. He admits he would be honoured for Noble to coach the team he is attempting to assemble at Salford. Another Brian - the Australian Brian Smith - is the other frontrunner. I understand Noble is keen to work with Koukash, but only if he is convinced the dream of this businessman, tempted into the sport by the RFL's chief executive Nigel Wood, can become a reality. A similar discussion about ambition and available funds saw Noble drop out of the running for the Castleford Tigers job before the appointment of Ian Millward, so Salford fans should not expect this to be a done deal. Key to the 'Good Doctor's' dream - he was labelled the 'Mad Doctor' during his outlandish early claims of racehorse success - is his campaign to raise the sport's 1.8m salary cap. Koukash has, for the past few weeks, been lobbying to lift the limit that a club can spend on players to something nearer 2.5m. His argument is that this will not only make the rugby league a more attractive proposition for the best players in Australia and halt a talent drain to rugby union, but even reverse the process and tempt union players to league. Noble agrees that the cap may need a rethink - it was introduced to stop clubs overspending. But the only man to coach a club to three Super League Grand Final victories believes we might now need a carrot to bring in the bigger names to raise the sport's profile. How much of a financial risk would this be? This is a time the sport cannot even attract a title sponsor for Super League - a situation branded unacceptable by the St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus, who cites his own club's deal with tea-makers Typhoo as proof that the sport can pull in the blue-chip brands. Media playback is not supported on this device Koukash clearly has cash and he wants to be able to spend it. But not every club is in a position to chase success in this way. Morley suggests there should be a loophole introduced to have two or three star name players paid as much as you like outside of the salary cap. Koukash added There should be a mechanism in the sport to allow certain scenarios, clubs or situations to go and spend above the cap. The man who made his millions from racehorses clearly feels he will be unable to attract rugby league's thoroughbreds to Salford under the current guidelines. Such an argument is unlikely to be met with a huge nod of approval from the likes of Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington who has built his own successful business model on a strict sliding salary scale at the Super League champions. The bigger question of course is that of the sport's profile in World Cup year. McManus says this is rugby league's biggest single financial weakness. This is not a question about allowing Salford to sign as many players as they want. It is about maximising the exposure of the sport to the world and reaping the financial rewards of that. McManus says the game's governing body needs to take responsibility. No sponsor is not acceptable. Either from the club's perspective or from that of the governing body, he said. Someone has to be answerable for that. It is something none of us are happy with and someone needs to be accountable. McManus feels that if these weaknesses in the way the game is marketed are readily identified and dealt with then the game has never been in a stronger position to prosper and grow. Koukash will expect to be at the forefront of that.",

    "input": "According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men. Given such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed the Cinderella cancer. We just don't make enough of it according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked. Based at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered. What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity. And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour. But if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage? That - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological GeneEnvironment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer. The results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer. It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer, says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years. If that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery. Sitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive. As with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum. The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery says Prof Neal. It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient.",

The Campaign to Protect Rural England CPRE will put its case to a High Court judge on 23 October. The five-storey university blocks provide 439 accommodation units. The flats overlook a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. CPRE is seeking the judicial review on the basis of Oxford City Council not carrying out an environmental impact assessment. The council has said the challenge was late as the housing had already been built, and it believed the group's claims were unfounded. Helen Marshall, director of CPRE Oxfordshire, said the West Area Planning Committee should under no circumstances be rushed into making further poor decisions. We are not yet convinced that the planning condition on contamination has been met, she added. And the mitigation proposals currently suggested by the university are woefully inadequate to counteract the devastating impact of the buildings on Port Meadow and Oxford's historic skyline. A few trees growing to approximately half the height of the buildings in 15 years' time will not meet the brief of 'hiding the buildings in summer and softening their impact in winter' Key issues such as the height of the buildings and light pollution still need to be addressed. A University of Oxford spokesman said it had thought carefully about how best to mitigate the impact of the buildings. Some measures have already been put in place, and discussions with the city council and others are ongoing about what more we can do, he added. The University will be making representations at the interim hearing in October on the procedural issues raised by the challenge. In the meantime, we intend to finish and occupy the buildings by the start of the next academic year in October as planned. The city council said last month it was carrying out an independent review into the case. An online petition against the development on Roger Dudman Way has attracted more than 3,000 signatures.",

    "input": "It's hard to tell which blow took us more by surprise, the first ever positive steroids test in the history of Scottish rugby, or the fact that and think it's unfair that so many Scottish, Welsh and Irish teams qualify for the Heineken Cup from a league without relegation. But let's start with to bulk up and get on in rugby, and leave the Heineken Cup for another day. The public statement made by Sam Chalmers, son of one of our finest ever players Craig, is that he is sorry and that he got the stuff off the internet. It has shades of the convenient lone wolf theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it? Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand Here is my thinking I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now. What I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you. Some players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more. Coaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards. Perhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice. So is it possible to get big enough taking food alone? The IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men's and women's Tests and Age Grade Rugby. The programme saw a total of 21 anti-doping rule violation cases, equating to 1.36 of the IRB's entire programme. That means around 1.4 of elite level players take drugs and try to get away with it. Some of them, you can see from the website, were caught taking the steroid favoured by both Sam Chalmers and disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, stanozolol. The 2011 Word Anti-Doping Agency figures, also available on the IRB website, show there were 5,553 drug tests globally in rugby in 2011, and 61 violations within them - just over 1. My guess is that there are more chancing it lower down the leagues, or in that scramble to get into the system - but I don't know. When I was in South Africa covering the 1995 Rugby World Cup I wrote then what I repeat now - that the biggest growth in requests at GPs in Capetown nearly 20 years ago was from schoolboys wanting prescriptions for steroids. They were often accompanied by parents. Could this happen here? Sam Chalmers was in the most susceptible group, which is young lads who want to get into professional, or at least top-level, rugby. It's going to be tough on him. But life's not easy. It wasn't easy for the players and coaches in the Bloodgate affair, or in the various eye-gouging allegations, nor for the other 60-odd rugby players caught by the IRB taking drugs or tampering with their samples. This is a test. He does his time and then he gets back in the game. I will leave you with this thought I bet you he wasn't alone in this. And I bet there are younger players than Sam Chalmers who haven't been caught. What do you think? Are there pressures on players to take steroids?

    "input": "An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS 2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time vetting eligibility of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to turn GPs into border guards and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a fair contribution. Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must transcend financial concerns, but collecting an extra 500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one, he added. By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent The issue of which foreigners are entitled to treatment and which are not is complex. The first thing to say is if someone needs emergency care - for example if they have an accident - the NHS will treat them no matter where they come from. Another exemption is if someone has an infectious disease as treatment helps protect the wider public. Beyond that the UK has reciprocal agreements with most European countries and 28 other nations, including countries such as Canada and Australia. It means if their residents need care while here temporarily - either on holiday or working - they will be seen and the NHS will then reclaim the cost of that care from the other country. The research released by the Department of Health shows the NHS is not very good at clawing that money back. This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify. Meanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed. The rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the most thorough research there has ever been in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions, but it says the estimates are the best that can be made at present, and Mr Hunt said researchers had been completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know. The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a 200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area EEA staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise 200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, deliberate health tourism - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between 60m and 80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is uncertain and the plausible range of the cost is 20m-100m. Frequent visitors taking advantage by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further 50m-200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the conservative 500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just 73m a year is recouped out of more than 460m at present. This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment. But he added the figures were based on a large number of assumptions and was more about spin than substance. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's 500m savings figure was exaggerated, partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed 200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to get their money's worth, and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than 200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a new border agency in policing the NHS. The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments, she said.

Irvine, 28, also won silver in the points race at the World Championships plus a World Cup gold in Manchester and a European bronze this year. This is a tremendous honour, said seven-times Irish champion Irvine. I want to thank BBC Northern Ireland for this award as it is fantastic recognition for everything that has happened in the past year and also for the sport of cycling which has been going through somewhat of resurgence in popularity recently. I'm really looking forward to the next year with the Commonwealth Games, the World Championships and hopefully the Giro d'Italia. With any luck I will be chatting to some of the guys from BBC Sport NI from a podium sometime next year! After winning his historic world gold and silver in Belarus during February, Irvine then suffered a fractured hip at a road race event in Taiwan a month later which ruled him out until August. However, the battling Irvine regained his fitness to win bronze at the European Track Championships in Netherlands before taking victory in the World Cup points event in Manchester two weeks later. The judging panel of Northern Ireland sports journalists chose Irvine ahead of runner-up AP McCoy and motorcyclist Michael Dunlop. Others shortlisted for the award were boxer Carl Frampton, Ireland cricket captain William Porterfield and triathlon star Aileen Reid. The panel of judges comprised of Shane Glynn, editor Sport BBC NI, BBC NI sports reporter Nikki Gregg, Belfast Telegraph sports editor Stephen Beacom, Kenny Archer of the Irish News, News Letter sports editor Richard Mulligan and author and freelance journalist Orla Bannon. Once again the judging panel had a tough decision to make this year but we felt that Martyn's achievements were just outstanding, said BBC NI sports editor Glynn. I'm delighted that he's been voted BBC Northern Ireland's Sports Personality of the Year for 2013. To become a world champion, literally within an hour of winning a silver medal in another discipline, is nothing short of phenomenal. And to beat the likes of AP McCoy and Michael Dunlop to this award speaks volumes about Martyn's achievements.",

She was sentenced to 50 months in prison after being caught falsifying records of emerging markets trades. Hong Kong regulators said RBS's controls were seriously inadequate. The Securities and Futures Commission SFC also said there were significant weaknesses in its procedures, management systems and internal controls. But the regulator said the fine took into account the bank's speedy action in alerting the authorities once it had discovered the illegal trades, which took place in its emerging markets rates business in 2011. This deserves substantial credit and is the reason why today's sanctions are not heavier ones, Mark Steward, the SFC's head of enforcement, said in a statement. RBS responded with a statement, reading We put in place a comprehensive remediation programme that strengthened our governance and supervisory oversight, and our control environment. The fine is relatively small compared to others the bank has received in the last few years. In December RBS agreed to pay 391m euros 320m in penalties to the European Commission for its role in the attempted rigging of Yen Libor and Euribor - the Tokyo and euro equivalents of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In the same month it was fined 100m 60m by US regulators for violations of US sanctions against Iran, Sudan, Burma, and Cuba.

    "input": "As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops. One of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note. After his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level. Harry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914. He went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated in zoology and botany. Ironically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause. I said to one 'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?' He said 'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.' So I said 'Well, bugger that.' Pincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943. After the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor. One of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme. He wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it. I'm up for use any time, he said. If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me! But it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle. His investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things. His favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster. Only after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB. MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it, he said. All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action they like to know. 'It's in the files if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy. Pincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside. In the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse. Lord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting. He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his. In 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's Â5 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences. This was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than Â4 million to the Treasury. In 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies. This prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability. After his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy. There was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying. In the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole. Not everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor. Rupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service. Personally I've seen the evidence I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963. Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that but I am persuaded there was a mole. One of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication. Margaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher. In May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked secret, to his minister of defence. I do not understand, he wrote, how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher? I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters. And the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967. What became known as the D notice affair began with a walk-in, a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop. The information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ. Before publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee. The D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published. Lohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop. Wilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express. In his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations. He said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed. I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay, he said. When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.",

    "input": "The government has called in proposals to shut St Joseph's Primary in Milngavie near Glasgow. The council plans to build a new denominational primary in nearby Bearsden - replacing both St Joseph's and the school on the site at present. Parents at St Joseph's and the Catholic Church have been fighting the plan. East Dunbartonshire Council plans to merge St Joseph's Primary with St Andrew's Primary in neighbouring Bearsden. The merged school would be sited in a new building on the current St Andrew's Primary School site. When the Scottish government calls in any proposal to close a school, it examines the process followed by the council and the information used to reach the decision. But it cannot simply overturn a decision because it disagrees with it. A letter informing the council of the government's decision said ministers were concerned by allegations the council's consultation document contained inaccurate information. It also said concerns raised by Education Scotland may not have been fully addressed by the council in the consultation. A spokesman for the parents at St Joseph's said Parents are delighted that the Scottish government has decided to call this process in. It is now clear that the way East Dunbartonshire Council has conducted this process has more holes than a colander. We believe and ministers appear to agree that our children will receive the best possible education in their own community. Council leader Rhonda Gheekie said This is a complex process and it's understandable that the Scottish government wants to investigate the proposal further. We welcome the same opportunity to explain in greater detail the educational benefits that we believe will come from our proposal to build a new 9m denominational primary school for Bearsden and Milngavie. We understand the significance of any new school build for the local community and what we all have in common is that we want to get it right to ensure the best possible future education for the young people in the area. The council said its proposals were part of its Primary School Improvement Programme to modernise the primary school estate. This aims to deliver state of the art primary schools which are better for pupils and cheaper to run and maintain. Ms Geekie added The council must save a further 20m from its budget over the next three years. On top of the 40m we have already saved, doing nothing in terms of our school estate to help address this was never an option. We have to ensure that our school buildings are as cost-effective as they can possibly be to ensure that we are getting value for money from our budget spending. Meanwhile, the council's plan to close two primary schools in Kirkintilloch and establish a new 7m school to replace them are to go ahead. The new school there is expected to open in 2016 or 2017.",

A neurosurgeon said last month that he died from a brain condition linked to boxers rather than Alzheimer's disease as previously thought. Dawn Astle said We want to stress the immediate message in dealing with head injuries and concussions, to discuss the FA's medical policies on this and work on player education. The issue has to be taken seriously because it's about lives. It's not like a back or knee injury, because once the brain is damaged it doesn't repair itself and Dad is proof of that. Ms Astle said Dr Willie Stewart, who carried out a new examination of Mr Astle's brain, would also be at the meeting. Astle's family have campaigned for the FA to carry out research into the risks of heading footballs and players suffering concussion. The Justice for Jeff group has also held protests at West Brom games. The FA previously apologised to the family for not keeping them informed about its work and said its rules on concussion were due to be changed ahead of the 201415 season. A spokesman for the FA said Mr Dyke had been keen to meet the Astle family for a long time to hear their concerns. It was initially believed Astle died from Alzheimer's disease, but the coroner at his inquest ruled his brain had been damaged by heading heavy leather balls. He played for West Bromwich Albion from 1964-1974 scoring 137 goals in 292 league appearances.",

    "input": "The Toffees, back in the tournament for the first time since 2010, controlled much of the game as a Ricardo Rodriguez own goal and a Seamus Coleman header gave them a 2-0 half-time lead. Leighton Baines put the game beyond Wolfsburg with a second-half penalty. Kevin Mirallas drilled in a late fourth for Everton before Rodriguez grabbed a consolation with a curled free-kick. The win puts Everton top of Group H and was just reward for manager Roberto Martinez, who underlined his intention to take the competition seriously by naming a strong side, after calling it the perfect next step for the club. The Toffees narrowly missed out on the Champions League last season as they finished fifth in the Premier League, but with their participation in this season's Europa League ending a four-year absence, Martinez has expressed a determination to go as far as possible. Everton's attacking display on Thursday will certainly give him confidence of progressing from a group that also contains French side Lille and Russians FK Krasnodar. Martinez had opted not to rest any of his first-team regulars for the visit of Wolfsburg, naming the same side that defeated West Brom 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday. Romelu Lukaku got his first of the campaign in that game and the striker spearheaded an exciting, attacking quartet that also included Aiden McGeady, Naismith and Mirallas. They have all contributed to Everton's impressive statistic of having scored at least two goals in every game this season, and it was of little surprise they each played significant roles in the goals against Wolfsburg. Naismith was the first to make a telling contribution, forcing the opener with Everton's first attack. After winning possession, Naismith ran into the area to receive a Baines pass before stabbing a shot at goal. Rodriguez tried to clear, but the ball cannoned off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, and hit the Wolfsburg full-back again before ending up in his own net. That was Everton's first goal in Europe at Goodison Park since beating Sporting Lisbon 2-1 in February 2010, and it had the buoyant home crowd hungry for more. Everton duly attempted to deliver, with full-backs Baines and Coleman becoming more adventurous as Wolfsburg offered little going forward, and their attacking instincts resulted in the home side's second goal on the stroke of half-time. Mirallas's drive was weakly pushed into the path of Baines, who had followed the shot into the area, and he knocked the ball across goal for Coleman to nod in. Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking introduced Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt for the start of the second half, but within seconds of the restart Everton went further ahead. This time, Robin Knoche's foul on McGeady was deemed to have occurred inside the area, and Baines confidently despatched the resulting penalty. The goal effectively ended Wolfsburg's hopes of returning to Germany with anything to show but, with nothing to lose, they embarked on a spell of dominance. For a good 30 minutes they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and attempts on goal, as Tim Howard produced saves from Luiz Gustavo's opportunistic shot and Rodriguez's well-struck free-kick. Former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner was introduced after the hour, with Wolfsburg boss Hecking sensing a possible goal, but instead it was Everton who grabbed a fourth. Mirallas peeled away from defenders to run on to substitute Samuel Eto'o's through ball and he coolly slotted in at Benaglio's near post. There was still time for Wolfsburg to get the consolation their 27 shots on goal deserved, Rodriguez making some amends for his early own goal with a curling free-kick. Everton boss Roberto Martinez The atmosphere was perfect for us to start a very good performance. I thought there were two very good sides. On the night the scoreline probably doesn't reflect the difference between the two sides. We scored at the right times. Our work-rate was magnificent. We had to defend and we did that really well but every time we went forward we had a clinical touch about us. Wolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking It's obviously not the start we'd hoped for. We were lacking in certain areas, both in terms of finishing and defensive work. We should have gone into half-time a goal down and we got hit with a second just before the break. Straight after the restart, 3-0 down and the game is lost. We really weren't smart enough and showed a certain naivety.",

The collection includes letters from Prince Charles and Truman Capote. Sir Patrick, who was known as Paddy, died in 2011 at the age of 96. He published several books on his travels around the world and one of the most prized items in the archive is the only surviving notebook from his 1933 trek across Europe. The trek provided the material for his most famous books, 'A Time of Gifts', 'Between the Woods and the Water' and 'The Broken Road'. Thousands of items which occupy 16 metres of shelving took a year to be catalogued by library staff. Along with letters from notable 20th century figures they also uncovered literary manuscripts, sketches and what appears to be an unpublished John Betjeman poem on the back of an envelope. Sir Patrick spent much of World War Two on Nazi-occupied Crete. During his time there he disguised himself as a shepherd to organise guerrilla operations against the Nazis. He led one of the most daring feats of the war in 1944, capturing the commander of the German garrison on Crete. The 1957 film starring Dirk Bogarde 'Ill Met by Moonlight' was based on the operation. Graham Stewart, the library curator who worked on the archive project, said It is a history of the colourful life of a celebrated writer. He was undoubtedly a superstar of his day and his books have, if anything, grown in popularity over the years. There has already been a lot of interest in the archive and we expect this to increase now among Leigh Fermor fans and people interested in the 20th century more generally. The library is working on digitising some of the archive so it can be viewed on its website. They are also considering holding exhibitions and displays of the collection so more people will be able to see it. The archive was given to the library by the John R Murray Charitable Trust. John Murray was Sir Patrick's publisher and the trust also supported the cataloguing of the collection.",

The team's findings are published in EMBO Molecular Medicine. Meliandou is a small village of 31 houses. It sits deep within the Guinean forest region, surrounded by towering reeds and oil palm cultivations - these are believed to have attracted the fruit bats carrying the virus passed on to Emile. During their four-week field trip in April 2014, Dr Fabian Leendertz and colleagues found a large tree stump situated about 50m from Emile's home. Villagers reported that children used to play frequently in the hollow tree. Emile - who died of Ebola in December 2013 - used to play there, according to his friends. The villagers said that the tree burned on March 24, 2014 and that once the tree caught fire, there issued a rain of bats. A large number of these insectivorous free-tailed bats - Mops condylurus in Latin - were collected by the villagers for food, but disposed of the next day after a government-led ban on bushmeat consumption was announced. While bushmeat is thought to be a possible source of Ebola, the scientists believe it didn't trigger the outbreak. Instead, it was Emile's exposure to the bats and their droppings as he played with his friends in the hollowed tree. The scientists took and tested ash samples from the tree and found DNA traces that were a match for the animals. While they were unable to test any of the bushmeat that the villagers had disposed of, they captured and tested any living bats they could find in and around Meliandou. No Ebola could be detected in any of these hundred or so animals, however. But previous tests show this species of bat can carry Ebola. Dr Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, and his colleagues say this must be a pretty rare occurrence though. Dr Leendertz said That is also obvious when you think about how many tonnes of bat meat is consumed every year. If more bats carried the virus, we would see outbreaks all the time. He says it is vital to find out more about the bats. They have moved into human settlements. They do not just live in the trees but also under the roofs of houses in the villages. The Ebola virus must jump through colonies from bat to bat, so we need to know more. But culling the animals is not the answer. We need to find ways to live together with the wildlife. These bats catch insects and pests, such as mosquitoes. They can eat about a quarter of their body weight in insects a day. Killing them would not be a solution. You would have more malaria.",

    "input": "While 50m is the starting point for serious wealth, in reality your spending power and investing power really gets to the next level when you get to around 100m, says Catherine Tillotson. Ms Tillotson is joint managing partner of Scorpio Partnership, a London-based firm which advises the super-rich on how to manage their assets, and she says there is a reason for this dividing line between the wealthy elite and the rest of us. This is the point at which families will start to think about employing people purely to help them manage their financial affairs, she says. There may now be more multi-millionaires and billionaires than ever before in the world, but since the 2008 global financial crisis the wealth gap between the world's top 1 and the rest of us has grown. This increasingly stark division between haves and have-nots is leading to increasing rancour towards the very wealthy, say many social commentators. Robert Kuhn is better placed than many to understand this hostility - a former investment banker and corporate strategist, he is himself among the world's wealthy elite. The world is getting wealthier - we live longer, eat better, are better educated and fewer people live in extreme poverty. But with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, the BBC is investigating the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015. A Richer World 2015 I think much of it is justified, he says, perhaps surprisingly, and I think we should describe why that's the case. One of the main reasons for this, he says, is the web. We have a very highly wired world with the internet, people are more aware of things - and I think that's a good thing. Mr Kuhn is coy about his own net worth. When asked if it is tens of millions of dollars, he replies, I would not like to be too specific, but I wouldn't contradict what you just said. Trained as a neuroscientist, Mr Kuhn became an investment banker and then in the early 1990s sold his mergers and acquisitions firm at the right time. He says he worked hard, but if I don't acknowledge there was a lot of luck involved I would be fooling myself. He wants to encourage more and more people to become wealthy, but also to place limits on the amount of wealth that can be passed on to the next generation. That gives each generation a chance to have higher social mobility. But given that the gap between rich and poor has reached its widest level for 30 years in most developed countries, according to says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD group of developed nations - that social mobility is getting harder for many. In the 1980s, the richest 10 had incomes seven times greater than the poorest 10 in the average industrialised country. Now, in those same countries, the richest have incomes nine-and-a half times greater than the poorest, on average. The actual figures vary widely across the 34 OECD's member states. In Denmark the top 10 earn about five times more than the bottom 10 - in Mexico they earn 30 times as much. How much more do the top 10 earn than the bottom 10? Source OECD 2011 Other organisations, too, are highlighting this discrepancy between rich and poor. A report this month from the charity Oxfam says the world's wealthiest 1 will own more than 50 of the world's wealth by 2016. This is something that we should be very worried about, says Mark Pearson, the OECD's deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs. If countries want to boost their economic growth, then they need to take steps to narrow this wealth gap, says the OECD. This goes against the longstanding free market argument that rising wealth at the top will trickle down to everybody else. But, the OECD research suggest that the reverse is true. Our finding is that by reducing income inequality, you can boost economic growth, Mr Pearson told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme. An increasing wealth gap hinders economic growth because it limits investment in a country's labour force, argues the OECD. Poorer people cannot afford to spend as much as the rich can on their children's education. And that lack of investment in education means a less educated and less flexible workforce in the long run, says the group in its research. It is not just the super-rich that are doing well - those whose business is dealing with super-rich customers are profiting too. Alex Cheatle is chief executive of Ten Group, a lifestyle concierge service that can helps its clients get that exclusive restaurant table, sell-out theatre ticket - or finds that vintage sports car in a particular colour. Ten will even do your window-shopping for you, if you are too rich or famous to be able to do it yourself. Very often they will want us to take a picture of the window and get it to them, so they do their window shopping as and when they want to, says Mr Cheatle. There hasn't really been a crisis for many of our members. Business is booming for us, we've grown every year since 2008 - growing at an average rate of 25-30 a year. When you consider how much the super-rich spend, that growth is perhaps not surprising. Over the course of a year, it's reckoned the world's top 1 spend a staggering 45bn 30bn on travel and hospitality, 40bn 26bn on cars, and 25bn 16bn each on art, jewellery and watches. Or course, the ultimate statement of wealth is to have your own super-yacht - complete with helicopter pad, speedboat tenders and even a submarine or two. The world's biggest such boat is currently the Azzam, 180m 590ft long, launched in 2013 at a reported cost of up to 600m 400m - and the sector has certainly weathered the global slowdown better than many others. Source Boat International So with the wealth gap rising should the rich pay more tax, and if so would that help? Robert Kuhn - now business and financial commentator - argues that countries that decide to increase taxes on the rich may not see any benefit. He believes increasing income taxes to too high a level would inhibit the creation of new wealth which is detrimental to society. I'm just worried about the behaviour and implications if you put too high a tax rate, what that will do to current generations in their energy and focus to create new wealth, says Mr Kuhn. At Scipio Partnership, Catherine Tillotson says that focussing on tax misses out the contributions made by many rich patrons to philanthropic and charitable causes. The tax question is hugely complicated, she says. Most families that I've met will say that it is absolutely critical to them that they pay the right amount of tax according to the rules. However, in many ways those dollars spent on philanthropic passions may be doing more good than they would have done in the tax system, she says. Yet ever since the financial crisis of 2008, and subsequent global economic slowdown, politicians have come under increasing pressure to increase tax contributions from the richest in their societies. Protest movements such as Occupy Wall Street, which started in 2011 and has since spread to many other countries, have highlighted concern over social and economic inequality worldwide. For his part, Robert Kuhn is not convinced that a widening wealth gap matters in economic terms, but it matters in social stability for sure, he agrees. It matters in terms of social mobility of subsequent generations. To me that's the biggest problem, for any country, he says. And many countries are facing that.

He didn't realise and believe what I was telling him. He added Chemotherapy is a hard treatment. I was just thinking after each session it was a day less I had to recover. I received a lot of support. To be back and train, do what you love, is another thing that makes you recover quickly. It was really emotional to be back. It was good to have a first step a few days before against Aston Villa and be on the bench, said Gutierrez. When I came on against United, I could just focus on the game. It was unbelievable and to get the armband was a great touch. Now I want to fight for my place. What is in my head is to work hard, do all I can to get minutes on the pitch.

    "input": "But the latest Cinderella is bucking the trend - and seemingly appealing to audiences as a result. Directed by Sir Kenneth Branagh, Cinderella is a live-action version of Disney's classic 1950 animation that has taken 70m Â43.1m on its opening weekend in the United States. Yet this adaptation is completely faithful to the traditional story - including wicked stepmother, fairy godmother, glass slipper, handsome prince and happy ending. British actress Lily James, best known as Lady Rose from ITV's Downton Abbey, stars as Cinderella. Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother. Keeping it classic is the twist, says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V. I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015. I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price. In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think. Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work. Helena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious as to whether a straight version would work. I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?' It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role. Just as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm. But James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her. This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother. She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone. This is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss, she says. I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name. I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella. James has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as irrelevant, claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her morals. Cate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is kindness, adding that it is an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength. There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming. Branagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it. People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters great cruelty and great kindness. This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature. And regardless of what happens to this film version, I believe this is why the tale of Cinderella will keep enduring. Cinderella is out in the UK on 27 March.",

    "input": "The move is in response to an 8m cut in the subsidy received from the Department of Employment and Learning DEL. The cut in undergraduate places will come into effect from September 2015. Job losses will be among both academic and non-academic staff and Queen's says no compulsory redundancies should be required. There are currently around 17,000 full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students at the university, and around 3,800 staff. Queen's has a current intake of around 4,500 undergraduates per year. The university aims to reduce the number of student places by 1,010 over the next three years. The BBC understands that there are no immediate plans to close departments or courses, but that the cuts in funding may put some departments and courses at risk. The Education Minister Stephen Farry said he recognised that some students might now choose to study in other areas of the UK because of the cuts facing Northern Ireland's universities. Some people will now be forced to look to opportunities in other parts of Great Britain and may not return to our economy, he said. Defunding our investment in skills, particularly at a time when we're trying to grow the economy does not make a lot of sense. What's happening is we're going backwards. The loss of any place is damaging to our economy, all subjects teach our young people critical skills. Queen's vice-chancellor Patrick Johnston said the cuts had the potential to damage the reputation of the university. The potential negative impact, not just on the university but on the local economy is very significant, he said. It's the last thing we want to do, but we have to begin to focus on those areas where we can grow the organisation and develop it - it's clear we can no longer depend on the public purse to fund tuition. If we're not competitive we will not attract the best students, and we will not attract the best staff. Just under 100m, a third of the university's income, comes from the Northern Ireland Executive. DEL's budget was reduced by 62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from 203m to 186m, a reduction of 8.2. Ulster University announced in February that it was dropping 53 courses. It will be cutting jobs and student places, but it has not yet revealed how many.",

The National Trust is using ground-penetrating radar on the 174ft 53m tower to see under its stone cladding. Ken Evans, from the trust, said the work was crucial. Built on one of the highest points of the Blackdown Hills, the landmark was put up as a tribute to the Duke of Wellington's military achievements at the Battle of Waterloo. But according to the trust, it has been struck by lightning twice in its history and renovating the very tall landmark every 10 to 15 years has been expensive and unsustainable. Mr Evans, the trust's building surveyor, said the radar study was one of several being carried out to understand this unique and somewhat complex monument. We have been using wind and movement sensors which have already surprised us by showing that it doesn't flex in the wind quite as much as we expected, he said. The ground-penetrating radar seeks to identify voids and gaps in the stonework under the surface but should also tell us more about the materials which were used to build the obelisk. Data from the detailed survey will also be used to build a computer model of the obelisk and help with a more effective repair approach.",

The proposal was blocked by the US, the UK and Canada. The next review is set for 2020. Israel neither confirms nor denies it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons. Speaking after four weeks of negotiations, US Under-Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller accused Egypt and other Arab countries of not willing to let go of these unrealistic and unworkable conditions for future talks. She also said some participants tried to cynically manipulate the whole process. But Egypt warned that the failure to reach a deal will have consequences in front of the Arab world and public opinion, the Associated Press news agency reports. Last month, Egypt had proposed to stage a regional conference - with or without Israel's participation and without an agreed agenda. Some analysts suggested that this move might have forced Israel - which is not a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons NPT - to publicly clarify its position on nuclear weapons. Decisions at NPT review conferences - held every five years - are made by consensus. The failure of the current talks means the next gathering could only be held in 2020 at the earliest.",

    "input": "Industrial-strength extremists cannot be dealt with just with force of arms, he said in a rare interview. During the Iraq war, Mr Petraeus devised the strategy that saw a surge in US troop numbers and secured support from Sunni tribesmen against al-Qaeda. Iraq's US-backed army is now battling to retake territory seized by IS. Gen Petraeus described the group as a formidable enemy. It is really a conventional army that also has elements of an insurgency, and indeed significant terrorist elements as well, he said. But when asked to compare IS with its predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq - which Gen Petraeus was instrumental in defeating - he said the latter had much greater roots in Iraq and much greater numbers than IS. The retired general characterised the recent capture by IS of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province, as a strategic loss in the sense that the narrative of IS being on the defensive - of losing - was shown to be somewhat hollow. I do think Ramadi will be retaken in a matter of weeks or less, he added. But this was a big setback. At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that's what's going on right now. 1974 Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army 2007 Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict 2008 Head of US Central Command 2010 Nato commander in Afghanistan Mid-2011 Leaves military to become CIA director November 2012 Resigns over affair After commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair. Subsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge. But despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years. He was the architect of the surge in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level. He also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda. Not surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill. The keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step. You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms, he said. You have to have that political component as well. Political change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it. As to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts. During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight, he insists. We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight. That looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details. Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional level? he asks. Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them? Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort? Can we accelerate the delivery of some of the equipment that Iraq so desperately needs? It sounds like the elements of a blueprint for a re-invigorated US effort. But then again - typical Petraeus - there is the political dimension. Are we doing all that we can to empower and support those Iraqi leaders, starting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who recognise the need to bring the Sunni Arab population back into the fabric of Iraqi society? And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa? In response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel. We need to see the same elements of this previous comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans. Gen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements. He says that more such fighters will spring up once the programme gets under way. And he is very cautious about any Iranian role in combating IS. He insists Iran remains a revolutionary power in the region. This is a country that has made progress because of chaos. It has both benefited from chaos and fomented chaos to try to achieve regional hegemony, he says. So he believes that while there can indeed be some coincidence of interest between the US, its coalition allies in the region and Iran in terms of the defeat of IS ... the over-arching context is one that gives you reason to have considerable caution in how you go forward in the relationship with Iran. Gen Petraeus still travels to Iraq regularly. He knows the key players well. And though out of uniform and established in a civilian career as an adviser, he remains the man who did achieve a kind of success in Iraq. That is a commodity that is in short supply today for the Americans and the Iraqi authorities. This makes the Petraeus approach an attractive model. But the question remains Can the outcome be the same with the Iraqi military cast in the role of the Americans?",

Mr Bedford was last seen on the evening of 28 September at Factory Bank, off Great Whyte, Ramsey. Three people were arrested in connection with his disappearance but no-one was charged. In April, Cambridgeshire Police reopened the investigation as a murder inquiry, saying they believed he had been shot. Detectives think Mr Bedford was killed with a shotgun sometime during the evening of 28 September at a garage called Mongrel Cars, which no longer exists, in Ramsey. They began searching land in the town in April. Bones consistent with being human were found by scenes of crime officers, forensic scientists and detectives during the 13-day operation. Det Ch Insp Martin Brunning, who is leading the murder inquiry, said The bones were discovered during a painstaking search of the area we had identified as being of interest. An expert in forensic anthropology has assisted the investigation and the bones will now be subject to DNA testing and much more intrusive forensic analysis. Mr Bedford was last seen eating a takeaway in a light blue Ford Cortina car. He was wearing overalls, a khaki jumper, jeans and trainers. He was described as 5ft 8in 1.72m, medium build with mousey blond, curly, shoulder-length hair and had a number of tattoos.

    "input": "The exhibition, From Dark to Light, explores the work of artist Victor Noble Rainbird, who was born in North Shields in 1887. The largest collection to have been staged since the 1930s, his favourite subjects were the North Sea and the streets and people of his hometown. Curator Dave Young said there was a lot of affection for him in the town. Many of the pieces on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre in North Shields have never been seen in public before. Mr Young, said We hope that this exhibition will shed new light on the life and work of a remarkable man and also a much misunderstood artist. This is the first major exhibition of his paintings to be held in his hometown of North Shields since the artist's lifetime and it is being held in a building that he would have known well and often painted. Victor Noble Rainbird's paintings are a fascinating legacy of life in the North East before and after the Great War, while his own remarkable war record is only now being unravelled. Mr Rainbird joined the Northumberland Fusiliers in 1914 when he was 26-years-old and served on the Western Front at Ypres, Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge and Armentieres. Some of the drawings he produced while on active service have survived and are included in the exhibition. Mr Young said they were a poignant, important and sombre record of the horrors of war. After the war, Rainbird made several return trips to France, Belgium and the Netherlands, producing some of his most impressive works. He died aged 47 in 1936. From Dark to Light exploring the life and art of Victor Noble Rainbird is on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre from 10 July to 6 September.",

    "input": "The proceedings in London will be the first time that undercover policing has been exposed to the rigour of public examination, he told a court. Helen Steel, who had a relationship with an undercover officer, said police committed human rights abuses. But police said undercover officers can play an important role. Lawyers investigating allegations for the Home Office say they have uncovered more than 80 possible miscarriages of justice relating to undercover policing. Investigations revealed officers had also had relationships with women while undercover, and had used the names of dead children. Undercover The allegations made to date Opening proceedings at the Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Pitchford said It seems likely that the inquiry will expose both creditable and discreditable conduct, practice and management. At the conclusion of its investigation, the inquiry will report to the home secretary and make recommendations as to the deployment of undercover police officers in future. Jacqui, who had a son with a man she thought was a fellow animal rights activist, did not discover he was an undercover police officer until 25 years after he disappeared from her life. She told the BBC the discovery was like an earthquake. I want this inquiry to really get to the truth... and come to some conclusion about whether this money and human misery was worth it. She wants the officers themselves to have the chance to give evidence, perhaps anonymously, and not have to worry about the Official Secrets Act or what's going to happen to them. She hopes what happened to me... what happened to other women, will never happen again. There is no circumstance where having sexual relations in order to get information on a group, whatever the group is, is ever justified. The home secretary ordered the review after claims police spied on the family of Stephen Lawrence. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, said more than one judge should oversee the case, or its conclusions should be left to a jury. You have an old saying - two heads are better than one, he said. Sometimes one person might miss something and the other one can bring them back to where they're supposed to be. And Ms Steel said These undercover policing units have committed grievous human rights abuses which are absolutely shocking in a supposedly democratic society. We want to make sure they don't happen again to anybody else, and for that to happen we need the full truth to emerge. Case study Alison was a member of an independent political group in London in the 1990s when she formed a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy. They were together for five years and lived together for four. But Mark disappeared suddenly, saying he'd had a row with his mother and was depressed. His disappearance five years after we met was very sudden and unexpected and didn't make sense. I spent a long time trying to find out where he was and why he'd left, Alison told Radio 4's Today programme. She believes claims of depression were part of an exit strategy used by officers. I knew I had to get on with my life and I did that, but still carried on looking and searching when I could, she added. She later found out Mark had a wife and children. I've carried on with my life, I've met somebody else who I grew up with as a child which was the only reason I was able to trust them was because I knew that they were who they said they were. And I've been fortunate enough to have a family, but many of the women who this has happened to have not been so fortunate. Lord Justice Pitchford's inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice will look into police infiltration of political and social justice groups in England and Wales since 1968. The inquiry is expected to be split into three parts establishing what happened, examining the procedures adopted by police to prevent wrongdoing, and recommendations for the future. Preliminary hearings are due to start in the autumn and the inquiry is set to last three years. The inquiry's terms of reference include The allegations were first widely reported in 2011 when a former undercover officer, Mark Kennedy, offered to help defend, in court, six environmental campaigners whom he had infiltrated. That trial collapsed - and later the same year, there were further revelations of undercover relationships, one of which led to a child. By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The allegations of wrongdoing by undercover police officers that have emerged since 2011 have been extraordinary. That steady stream of stories has led to the launch of a major public inquiry into their activities. The breadth and nature of what is being alleged is almost too big to grasp, but it fundamentally comes down to a simple question of whether elements of the police were out of control. Seven key issues the inquiry will examine. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said undercover policing was an important tactic, but had to be done legally. He told BBC London We, for the police, will make the case that our undercover officers are incredibly brave and they deal with some very dangerous people. We think this is a vital part of our toolset and if we don't have it then we don't suffer, but the public might.",

Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant has written to councils reminding them of the temporary ban on fracking in Wales. He said fracking technology was unproven, saying Welsh ministers preferred to look at renewable energy. Fracking is a process of using high pressure water to break up rocks deep underground to release gas and pipe it to the surface. It is a major industry in the United States, but there are concerns about safety, the environment and underground water. There have been protests against applications for test drilling for gas in both the Vale of Glamorgan and Wrexham, as well as sites in England. Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has stressed the UK government's support for fracking, and frustration at delays in its development. She has told councils in England to make decisions on applications within 16 weeks, to stop the process being dragged out for months. In his letter to Welsh councils, Mr Sargeant said the new guidance only applied to England and that the moratorium in Wales remained in place. The UK government's general support for oil and gas applications is contrary to the approach of the Welsh Government of promoting renewable and low carbon forms of energy through the planning system and other measures, he said. We still see renewable energy as a key element in ensuring that Wales achieves sustainable development for the benefit of future generations. Local planning authorities must ensure that planning applications for renewable energy projects are determined within statutory timescales. Plans to devolve control over fracking were confirmed in the Queen's Speech in June following the Conservatives' general election victory.",

The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas. Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved. Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a thorough assessment of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months. It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this, a spokesman said. Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment. The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects. However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was unproven, and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.",

West Sussex chief fire officer Sean Ruth said the recovery operation was extremely challenging for crews. Sussex Police have also finished their work at the scene, but their investigations are continuing. Mr Ruth said the fire service had been truly humbled by the messages of support it had received. The thoughts and prayers of everyone at West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service continue to be with the families and friends of those killed and injured in the Shoreham Air Show tragedy, he said. He anticipated that Friday would be the last day his crews worked at the scene and wanted to thank people for the over-whelming support we have received. In my 27 years of service I have never experienced such an outpouring of gratitude and respect as I have received on behalf of West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service over the last few weeks - from letters and emails, to words of thanks in the street, and from visitors at a number of our local fire stations, he said. Det Chief Insp Carwyn Hughes, of Sussex Police, said Our officers and staff have been meticulous and have worked hard over the past three weeks to find answers for the victims' families. We have now finished work on the A27, however our investigation continues. On Thursday, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch AAIB said it wanted to interview 51-year-old pilot Andy Hill as soon as possible. Reports that Mr Hill, a former RAF pilot from Sandon, near Buntingford in Hertfordshire, had left hospital have not been confirmed by police. An initial AAIB report said Mr Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash, but it is not clear whether he initiated his ejection. After the crash, the pilot's family issued a statement which said they were devastated and deeply saddened by the loss of life and sent prayers and heartfelt condolences to the families of all those affected. West Sussex County Council said the single closed westbound lane of the A27 was expected to be reopened to traffic next week but screens will stay up on the roadside indefinitely for reclamation work on the land to be completed.",

The White House said North Korea should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations. The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal. But Pyongyang vowed to restart it in 2013, following its third nuclear test and amid high regional tensions. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the international community would not accept North Korea as a nuclear state. We will work with our partners in the context of the six-party talks to try to return North Korea to a posture of fulfilling those commitments that they have made, he said. We will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from the irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tension and should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments. Six-nation talks involving South Korea, the US, China, Japan and Russia aimed at ending the North's nuclear programme have been stalled since 2009. Experts believe that, when fully operational, the Yongbyon reactor can make one nuclear bomb's worth of plutonium per year. A US think-tank said this year that satellite images suggested work had started at the Yongbyon complex. But Tuesday's announcement was the first official confirmation from North Korea that it had restarted operations there. The state-run news agency KCNA said North Korea was improving its nuclear weapons in quality and quantity. It said that the North was ready to face US hostility with nuclear weapons any time. However, experts say North Korea's nuclear capabilities are unclear. Pyongyang claims it has made a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead on to a missile, which it could launch at its enemies. But US officials have cast doubt on the claim. North Korea has made bellicose threats against its neighbours and the US before, often to coincide with annual joint military exercises held by South Korea and US forces. The two Koreas remain technically at war, because the 1950-1953 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.",

Fly-half Bernard Foley kicked all Australia's points, with Dan Bigger twice on target for Wales. Australia now face Scotland in the quarter-final on 18 October, with Wales against South Africa the day before. It was Wales' 11th consecutive defeat against the Australians, a run going back to 2008. Wales coach Warren Gatland's men had their chances but were repelled by some extraordinary defence, with number eight Taulupe Faletau dropping the ball inches from the line and George North at centre held up over the line by Wallabies back-row Ben McCalman. In the long run of narrow losses to Australia, this will rank among the most frustrating for Gatland. There was a lack of composure in a 10-minute period around the hour mark, when Australia's battling 13 held firm. And having seen off the barrage, the Wallabies eventually lifted the siege and were rewarded when Foley's fifth penalty gave his side a two-score cushion with eight minutes remaining. Australia stated their intentions in the opening seconds when they opted to take a scrummage from the first penalty of the game deep in their own half. They almost paid a high price when Gareth Davies sprinted away down the narrow side. But Biggar's fourth-minute penalty was all Wales had to show for their early pressure. Two unyielding defences battered anything that moved, with the breakdown a genuine contest and Wales successfully countering the Wallabies' driving maul. However, as the half wore on and Australia's pack - and scrummage in particular - got on top, the penalty count mounted against the Welsh with Foley profiting. The match was a slow burner but it burst into life at the start of the second half. Australia drove the lineouts with more venom, but Wales took control after the Wallabies incurred the wrath of referee Craig Joubert. Scrum-half Will Genia had a yellow card for failing to retire 10 metres as his opposite number Gareth Davies took a quick penalty and Genia was followed into the bin when second-row Dean Mumm infringed at a lineout. However, Australia's defence while reduced to 13 was simply heroic. Australia's seemingly easier path to a possible final - avoiding South Africa and New Zealand en route - is reward for a courageous and skilful rearguard action. They will look forward to their battle with the Scots, while Wales face a resurgent Springbok side. The nature of yet another defeat to Australia, however, will leave a bitter taste in the mouth. Gareth Davies of Wales was a livewire for the whole of the game and won this accolade. But this was a match won by the defence of Australia.

    "input": "It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid 20,000 Â13,000 for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease. We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out, says Mr Badr. None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through. Three years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club. Mr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer about 80,000 a year, but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers. And he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space. Mr Badr says I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient. That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve. Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US. An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8 over the next five years to 344.6m in 2020. When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin, says Mr Badr. But now there are five comedy schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time. While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age. The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent, he says. In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars. Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news. It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them, he says. There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging. But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40 of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person. A club really has three businesses going on, says Mr Rosenfield. It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge. There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics. The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year. Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed 19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn 36m this year. Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons. He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring. And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income. Mr Bryne says Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at. If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be 1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from 4,500 to 7,500. And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions. Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks. The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh? Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience. While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost. The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits, he says. It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it. Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while. But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh. Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September. He says We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'. But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet. And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.",

    "input": "The All Blacks were five points behind at half-time with a man in the sin-bin as four penalties from Handre Pollard cancelled out Jerome Kaino's early try. A Dan Carter drop-goal and a Beauden Barrett try put the champions ahead. South Africa replied with two penalties but a Carter effort in between secured victory despite ferocious Bok defence. It was seldom pretty but once again in this World Cup there was a gripping finale, the All Blacks holding that two-point lead for the last 12 minutes as their opponents finally tired. No team has ever retained the Webb Ellis trophy, but the All Blacks will be favourites to do so when they meet either Australia or Argentina next Saturday after finding their way through a brutal encounter. This was nothing like the free-flowing attacking rugby that had eviscerated France in the quarter-finals, but in its own way it was just as admirable, as South Africa refused to buckle despite having just 43 possession. The game swung in the 20 minutes after half-time, New Zealand beginning that period five points down and with Kaino off the pitch, but ending it five points up and with Springbok wing Bryan Habana in the sin-bin instead. And despite replacement Pat Lambie cutting the lead to less than a score, the vast experience of the champions saw them through. After Pollard's early penalty, the All Blacks struck back when Kaino thundered through De Jager down the right and touched down one-handed in the corner, but two more pin-point penalties from Pollard gave his side a two-point lead with 20 minutes gone. South Africa were having significant success at the breakdown, New Zealand shipping six penalties in short order, and the world champions looked instead for territory, kicking behind the defence and into the corners. Carter hit the post with a long-range penalty, and despite his side dominating possession and territory the Springbok defensive wall continued to hold. When South Africa finally made it out of their half, they struck again. Kaino was sin-binned for kicking the ball away and Pollard stroked over his fourth penalty to make it 12-7 at the interval, the green-shirted supporters in the capacity crowd starting to believe that the upset was on. The Springboks had not lost to the All Blacks in 21 Tests when leading or level at half-time, but despite being a man down New Zealand closed the gap to two points as a spell of carefully worked territory was capped with a Carter drop-goal. Schalk Burger then lost the ball metres from his own line, the All Blacks went right and drove on through their forwards before Ma'a Nonu sent replacement Barrett diving into the corner. With Habana sin-binned for knocking the ball from scrum-half Aaron Smith's hands and Carter bending over the conversion for 17-12, the match appeared to have turned. Pollard and Carter exchanged penalties, and with replacements pouring on to the pitch and the rain hammering down the two heavyweights went toe to toe. Pat Lambie came on for Pollard to make it 20-18 with 10 minutes to go, and an air of desperation was apparent in both sides. Carter sprinted half the length of the pitch to clear from De Allende, South Africa failed to capitalise from an attacking line-out and New Zealand escaped into opposition territory as the seconds crawled by, running the clock down with a series of drives to celebrate with exhaustion at the end. Ben Smith was faultless under the high ball and Dan Carter's decision-making once again peerless. However, for his muscular, repeated carrying in a relentlessly physical match and the superb run and timing of pass for Beauden Barrettt's critical second-half try, Ma'a Nonu deserves the honour. New Zealand coach Steve Hansen It was always going to be close, they're a great side and they showed that again. I was really proud of our guys, they kept their composure. We just needed to come out for the second half and start taking the game to them rather than waiting for them to take it to us. We talked about it at half-time. We talked about keeping composure and talked about winning the first 10 minutes. South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer Our discipline in the second half was just not good enough. They coped better with the weather in the second half. Discipline was the most important thing, especially in these rainy conditions. We wanted to make our country proud but we didn't. We should have pulled this win through but all credit to the All Blacks, they are a quality side.

Bradbury joined The Specials in 1979, and continued with the reversioned band The Special AKA, who had a top 10 hit with Free Nelson Mandela. Bradbury took part in The Specials reunion tour in 2009. He also headed up a band called JB Allstars. The band's representatives said the drummer died in England but no cause of death was given. In a statement, his family said It is with deepest regret that we have to announce the very sad news that our much loved husband and father John 'Brad' Bradbury passed away on Monday the 28 of December. Brad's drumming was the powerhouse behind The Specials and it was seen as a key part to the Two Tone sound. He was much respected in the world of drumming and his style of reggae and ska was seen as genuinely ground-breaking when The Specials first hit the charts in 1979. He was an integral part of The Specials reforming in 2008 and toured with them extensively up to the present day. His contribution to the world of music can not be understated and he will much missed by family, friends and fans alike. It is the family's sincerest wish that they are allowed the time to remember him privately. The news comes three months after the band's trombonist, Rico Rodriguez, died. The band, famed for their 1960s mod-style outfits, had seven UK top 10 singles including Too Much Too Young and Ghost Town. Founder and songwriter Jerry Dammers dissolved the band in 1981 but they re-grouped and continue to perform and record without their former leading man. Billy Bragg was one of the first musicans to pay tribute to Bradbury. A bad day for good music. First we lose Lemmy, now news that Brad from the Specials has passed away. RIP. Bradbury was born and brought up in Coventry where the band was formed in 1977. Music producer Pete Waterman, also from Coventry, expressed his shock at the news of the Bradbury's death. Speaking to BBC Coventry and Warwickshire, Waterman said I always had a good laugh with Brad. He was always proud of being in the band and what we'd and he'd achieved. He never left Coventry because he always wanted to be part of the scene... he was tremendous.",

As a doctor, I can understand the anger and frustration felt by many junior doctors at this time, Dame Sally said. In part, this dispute is a symptom of frustration and low morale that has been building for decades and the strain that a career in medicine can place on your work-life balance.

It is vital that, as senior medical leaders, we ask ourselves whether we are doing everything we can to ensure our junior colleagues feel valued.

They say there should be greater transparency of the terms agreed between Google and the government. A Pakistan Telecommunication Authority PTA official confirmed to the BBC that all internet service providers had been directed to open access to YouTube. The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd posted on its Facebook page on Monday Welcome Back YouTube. Pakistan's ministry of information technology said Google has provided an online web process through which requests for blocking access of offending material can be made by the PTA to Google directly. GoogleYouTube will accordingly restrict access to the said offending material for users within Pakistan. However, a YouTube spokeswoman said government requests for the removal of content would not automatically be granted. We have clear community guidelines, and when videos violate those rules, we remove them, she said. In addition, where we have launched YouTube locally and we are notified that a video is illegal in that country, we may restrict access to it after a thorough review. She said requests by governments for content to be removed would be recorded in YouTube's Transparency Report. Pakistan's ban on YouTube was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the US-made film Innocence of Muslims was uploaded.

Mr Betchley's daughter Linda said she feels angry that nothing has changed since he died.

Many of the items raised in this most recent report were raised back then. I don't see them being addressed soon. There is no leadership, there is no support for the actual nurses on the wards. Chief executive Frank Sims, who started in the role last month, admitted its biggest challenge is reducing our dependency on agency staff. We have got more staff employed now than we have ever had, and since September we have recruited 75 more qualified nurses but we have still got a long way to go. The trust which runs the hospital has been in special measures since 2013. The CQC has recommended it remains in special measures for the next three months, during which time it must submit a weekly improvement plan.

The books, in Sir Terry's birthplace of Limerick, will allow people to mark the passing of a true son of Limerick, the city's mayor Liam Galvin said. Evans told listeners of the BBC Radio 2 show that made Sir Terry's name He was the absolute governor. A condolence book for Sir Terry has also been opened in the entrance of the BBC's New Broadcasting House in London. In a career spanning 50 years, Sir Terry hosted TV chat shows, fronted the Eurovision Song Contest and was the face of Children in Need, while his long-running Radio 2 breakfast show regularly drew millions of listeners. At the start of his breakfast show on Monday, Evans said He was radio's Eric Morecambe, Ronnie Barker, he was our Captain Mainwaring, our Basil Fawlty but he made us laugh every day for two hours and for over 30 years. All unscripted, all ad lib, always supremely assured, unwaveringly confident. And do you know why? Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes. Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something. Evans described Sir Terry as his radio dad and said that Radio 2 was in disbelief and shock. He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio, added Evans. He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that. BBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry one of the greatest broadcasters of our age. Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish, he said. You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one. But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them. Prime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a wonderful human being. I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh. He had this fantastic sense of humour, he said. Veteran broadcaster Sir Jimmy Young, who worked with Sir Terry on Radio 2, said he was stunned at the news and that his condolences were very much with Helen and the family. Sir Terry died surrounded by his family after a short but brave battle with cancer, a statement released by his family said. He leaves his wife, Helen, and their three children. The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy. An online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning. The city's mayor said Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots. The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family. President of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was always proud of his origins in Limerick, and returned frequently to his native country. Family friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was shocked to hear of his death because Sir Terry had put it out that he had a bad back. The Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin. I didn't know he was that seriously ill. I knew he'd been told not to do Children In Need because, as he quipped himself, they don't want an 'oul fella of 77 standing up for ten hours asking for money. For so many people in this country, it is going to be like a death in the family - they adored Wogan, he added. Sir Terry had not been seen in public since November when he pulled out of hosting the annual Children in Need telethon. Blessed with a warm wit and a surreal sense of humour, Sir Terry was one of the BBC's most beloved broadcasters. His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance. He also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event. From 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan. The second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or Terry's Old Geezers and Gals. Tributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday. BBC director general Lord Hall said He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family. For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family. Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard. Sir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career. Radio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a radio genius, saying The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone. Sir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account. The singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing Such a special and funny man. A brilliant broadcaster and presenter. He came to our civil partnership celebration and was a loyal supporter. Members of Sir Terry's BBC Radio 2 fan club Terry's Old Geezers and Gals TOGs have paid tribute to his work and commitment to charity. Norman Macintosh, who organises the TOGs conventions, told BBC Breakfast He was the gentleman and the ultimate broadcaster. He talked to one person at a time and he felt like he was talking to you and he brought the whole audience into the show, and everyone felt like they were part of it. Sir Terry announced his retirement from Wake Up to Wogan in September 2009, making his final regular appearance three months later. When he broadcast at breakfast for the final time in 2009 he told listeners The years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you. When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine. Sir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015. The One Show A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 1900 GMT on Monday 1 February.",

    "input": "Many developing countries will try to curb carbon emissions by setting aside forested areas as reserves. But experts are worried that creating national parks often involves removing the people who live in these areas. The study indicated designating forest reserves in Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo could displace as many as 1.3 million people. With funding from Norway, Liberia has proposed 30 of their forests become protected areas by 2020. DR Congo, funded by Germany and the Global Environmental Facility, aims to set aside 12-15 of their forested lands. Consultants TMP Systems concluded Governments have targets to expand their protected areas, and now with new climate funding being available the risk is they will use this to expand in a way that doesn't respect local rights, said Andy White, from the Rights and Resources Initiative, the campaign group that sponsored the research. It could result in the displacement of millions of people. Analysts say that this type of displacement has already happened in sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and Latin America, and sometimes caused violent conflict. I don't think the international community wants to displace rural dwellers in Liberia - but I think if we go about it in the way we are talking about it right now, that is going to be the result, said Constance Teague, from Liberia's Sustainable Development Institute. We need to recognise that indigenous communities respect the forest and they have worked on it for hundreds of years. It may not look like what the international community may expect, but this effort to conserve the land does exist. Liberia had the largest forest space left in West Africa, largely because of the indigenous communities, she added. The report also looks into the costs of compensating people for the loss of their lands in both Liberia and DR Congo, which range from 200m Â137m to more than Â1bn. The main argument for setting up reserves is to And Mr White said We need to make evidence available that makes it clear that the woods are full of people, and it makes more sense to help them rather than kick them out. Where indigenous peoples rights are protected, and they are able to use their forests for their own livelihoods, they have more carbon per hectare than protected areas. They are active protectors, you don't have to pay a park guard, because they protect their forests, and that is what the world needs. Some 1.5 billion indigenous people inhabit or claim most of the land in the world - but, according to a study released last year, they have legal rights to just 10.

Mr Trump has won three of the first four contests held so far. Next week's vote in 11 states is held on what is known as Super Tuesday. The three men are seeking to be named as the Republican candidate in November's presidential election. At long last the Republican candidates have come to the realisation that Donald Trump can actually win this race, but it may be too late. For more than two hours, Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz took turns throwing punches at the New Yorker. They attacked him on his business record they mentioned hypocrisy they questioned his conservative credentials and they criticised the lack of detail in his policies and his reliance on bluster. We're having a lot of fun up here, aren't we? the front-runner quipped at one point. But the truth is that Mr Trump was on his heels for much of the evening. The challenge for the men who would unseat the leader, however, is that the best time to bludgeon a candidate is before it is clear circumstances are forcing you to act. In a campaign where authenticity is worshipped above all, Thursday's fireworks could smack of the kind of political expediency many associate with traditional politicians. Both Mr Cruz and Mr Rubio drew blood with their attacks but Mr Trump will be likely to emerge unbowed.

If he hadn't inherited 200m, you know where Donald Trump would be? Mr Rubio said in one tense exchange. Selling watches in Manhattan. Mr Rubio also criticised Mr Trump's failed online education venture, Trump University, and assailed him for hiring foreign workers rather than Americans in his construction projects. Mr Trump shot back I hired tens of thousands of people. You've hired nobody. The billionaire real estate mogul found himself increasingly on the defensive about his business dealings and his conservative credentials. In other exchanges The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at. Trump on Rubio This guy's a choke artist not able to deliver on stage. Rubio to Trump You're a lousy businessman. If he hadn't inherited 200m, you know where Donald Trump would be right now, selling watches in Manhattan. Trump to Cruz This guy is a liar. Cruz response Falsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie, and it's something Donald does daily. Trump to Cruz You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican senator backing you. Not oneâYou should be ashamed of yourself. I know you're embarrassed. Rubio to Trump You're the only person on this stage that's ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally. Trump response I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. I've hired tens of thousands of people over my job. You've hired nobody. You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards. Mr Trump has been extremely popular despite his controversial comments about deporting millions of undocumented workers and banning Muslims from travelling to the US. He is currently leading in 10 out of 11 states holding contests on Super Tuesday when a quarter of the total numbers of delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination will be up for grabs. He has 82 Republican party delegates, Mr Cruz has 17 and Mr Rubio has 16. To become the Republican party's nominee, a candidate has to have 1,237 total state delegates. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will compete for 1,004 delegates on Super Tuesday. Mrs Clinton has a clear lead with 505 delegates, but the majority are super delegates who can change their mind during the course of the campaign.

Digby Johnson, a partner at the Johnson firm, confirmed they did not represent Khan - who had set up his own office and was set to leave the company. I still find it hard to believe he could do something as stupid as involve himself in drugs and people who were heavily involved in drugs, Mr Johnson said. I'm just at a loss. You do question everything you've ever believed about anybody. Mr Johnson also described Khan, of William Street, Huddersfield, as a lovely guy who was incredibly hard-working. He would put in hour after hour, he added. He was keen to progress and impress. Khan appeared at the court via video link to admit conspiracy to supply the Class A drug.

    "input": "A statement announced the formation of a joint operations room following what it said was an increase in attacks on residential areas and displaced people. Rebels were said to have subsequently launched attacks in the province of Latakia and in neighbouring Hama. Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva said it intended to suspend formal peace talks. The cessation of hostilities brokered by the US and Russia to make way for the talks has resulted in a significant reduction in violence since it took effect on 27 February. But escalating fighting in recent days, particularly around the divided northern city of Aleppo, has left it on the verge of collapse. After the increase of violations by regime forces that included targeting displaced people and continuous bombing of residential neighbourhoods, we declare the start of the battle in response, said the rebel statement issued on Monday morning. The text was signed by the powerful Islamist groups Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam, as well as several groups that fight under the banner of the Free Syrian Army. Later in the day, the Syrian opposition negotiating team, the High Negotiations Committee HNC, said it intended to postpone formal participation in the peace talks, UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura said. Ever since Syria's truce came into force in late February, there have been repeated violations. But these new attacks are the most significant yet - rebel forces are attacking key front lines, and there have been repeated air strikes by the Syrian military. This upsurge in fighting is putting new pressure on fragile peace talks. Opposition delegates are now discussing if the time has come to leave Geneva - they are reported to have received a letter from rebel forces on the ground, urging them to exert more pressure on the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura who has been mediating in these indirect negotiations between the warring sides. The opposition is now accusing the UN of bias after Mr de Mistura floated a proposal to allow Syria's President Assad to remain in office, in a ceremonial role. I've heard that idea in recent months from Russian and Iranian sources. But Syrian opposition groups have flatly rejected it - their Western backers are urging them not to walk out but it is becoming increasingly clear that these talks are not going anywhere. The HNC wanted to express its disappointment at the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and in the cessation of hostilities, Mr de Mistura said. But the envoy added that the HNC would remain in Geneva and informal discussions with the two sides would continue with a view to taking stock on Friday. The US on Monday called on Russia to use its influence on the Syrian government to stop attacks that threatened the seven-week cessation of hostilities as well as the Geneva peace talks, a State Department official said. Separately, President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held an intense conversation on Monday that covered Syria, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Meanwhile, four Syrians including three children in the Turkish town of Kilis were killed in rocket fire from Syrian territory controlled by co-called Islamic State IS, the local governor's office said. The Turkish military fired artillery in response, Hurriyet newspaper reported. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebels had launched an assault on the positions of government forces and their allies in Latakia's northern countryside early on Monday and by midday had made advances. The UK-based monitoring group also said rebels were close to taking over the town of Khirbat al-Naqus, in the strategically important Sahl al-Ghab plain in the north-west of Hama province. A Syrian military source confirmed the attacks, according to the Reuters news agency. Latakia is the heartland of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, and the Sahl al-Ghab lies just to the east of the coastal mountains where Mr Assad's ancestral village of Qardaha is located. Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory said four people were killed in heavy government air strikes in northern Homs province. Twenty-two civilians were killed over the weekend in Aleppo, with at least 16 dying as a result of rebel shell- and sniper-fire and the six others dying in government air strikes, according to the group. Militants from the group known as Islamic State IS, which along with the rival jihadist group al-Nusra Front is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, have meanwhile seized more territory from rebel groups near the Turkish border north of Aleppo, forcing some 35,000 civilians to flee towards the opposition-held town of Azaz. Medecins Sans Frontieres warned on Monday that the situation was now critical for more than 100,000 displaced people trapped around Azaz, with active fighting just 7km four miles away and the border closed for all but the most seriously ill Syrians.",

    "input": "There's a lot going on right now, the singer tells us. And she's not wrong. The follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1. And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today, she adds. It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified. The singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear. Describing the concept as just hellish, she tells us I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'. So, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart. In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury. Her third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a genuine champion. He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why. I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special. Here the diary of Laura's day. Tour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day. I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big, she admits. I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up. Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can. We arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive. Laura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's glad you only find out on the day. I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers. I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album. Backstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn. There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise, says Laura. With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress. My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar and is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family. Still in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts. Running through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano. Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about? she laughs. Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now. Time for some nourishment. The team there's like millions of them... making it work are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in. I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine. Designer Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently, says Laura. He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight. I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book filled with images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'. It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps. Minutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands. She's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing with matching super-flared trousers will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved. With the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman. If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made, says Laura. There's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again. Later, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio. He made me cry so much, says Laura. I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel. I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon. With all the stars limbered up and the shortest of toilet breaks, the second show goes live on BBC Two. It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it.  Laura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman. That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?! It's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other. US outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap Because he's fine. And obviously amazing. I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is, says Laura. The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment. That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance. So what now? Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing grabs belly area that will never go away. But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out. I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!

    "input": "Unions at BAE Systems have warned of possible delays to funding for the Royal Navy's new frigates. But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson insisted there was no change to the timetable. Labour said it was vital that promises were kept while the Lib Dems called for an end to uncertainty. The UK government confirmed in its Strategic Defence and Security Review last November that eight Type 26 frigates would be built on the Clyde, although the total number was scaled back from 13. In the meantime, the yards are being sustained by Ministry of Defence orders for new offshore patrol vessels. But after briefings with management, the GMB union said last week that work on the new frigates would not begin until 2017 and raised concerns that up to 800 jobs could be lost if there was any backsliding on commitments. SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was gravely concerned by the developments. She said The future of both Govan and Scotstoun depend on these orders. Solemn promises were made in the run-up to the referendum and if those promises are broken, it will be seriously damaging for the shipyards but I think people across Scotland will feel very let down by the parties that made those promises. She added I think the government has the responsibility to make cast iron assurances here. Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said she had held discussions with shipyard workers and BAE management about the need to protect jobs. She said It's my deep regret that Labour didn't win the general election - so the Tories have to fulfil their promise to the workers in the yards, and I'll be making that case every step of the way. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie also expressed frustration about the uncertainty. There are serious concerns about the future of orders at the yards and it's important that the Conservative government gives an absolute commitment. We've got to end this feast and famine of orders at the yards, he said. The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, however, said she had been given assurances by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that nothing had changed. She said He confirmed there had been no change to the orders that were set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review last year. That means all eight Type 26 anti-submarine frigates that are coming, plus the light frigate order on top of that, and the two offshore patrol vessels. They are coming to the Clyde, as discussed last year, to the same timetable and the same number. A spokesperson for BAE Systems said Following the Strategic Defence and Security Review, we are working with the Ministry of Defence to agree a revised baseline for the Type 26 ships and a production schedule for the two additional offshore patrol vessels in Glasgow. We are engaging our trades unions as we work through this process. Our focus is to deliver the capability the Royal Navy needs, while ensuring the best value for UK taxpayers.",

    "input": "Media playback is not supported on this device The tournament kicks off with France playing Romania on Friday, 10 June and the final will take place at the Stade de France in Paris on 10 July. Spain are hoping to retain the title they won in 2008 and 2012. England will be appearing at their ninth finals, while Wales and Northern Ireland have qualified for the first time. Good question - because, for the first time, there are 24 teams competing in the finals. That is an increase from the 16 that had taken part in every edition since it was hosted in England in 1996. With six groups of four teams, it means the top two will qualify for the last 16, plus the four best third-placed finishers. In other words, only eight teams will fail to qualify from the group stage. One point could be enough to put your team into the last 16 - and from then the tournament goes to a knockout format. As Greece proved by pulling off a sensational triumph at Euro 2004, trying to predict a winner is a difficult game. World champions Germany are understandably one of the favourites, while holders Spain are also short odds with the bookmakers. Germany finished top of their qualification group but booking their place in France was not without its hiccups - with defeats by Poland and the Republic of Ireland. They have been beaten by France and England since qualifying but remain one to watch. Spain dominated international football between 2008 and 2012 but failed to qualify from their group at the 2014 World Cup. Could this be a last hurrah for Vicente del Bosque's ageing but brilliant side? France won the World Cup as hosts in 1998 - can they repeat the famous success of the team led by Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane and Laurent Blanc? A run into the latter stages by Les Bleus is likely to help restore national morale in a country still recovering from last year's deadly Paris attacks. France are the bookmakers' favourites to win the whole thing, but their form is tricky to gauge because they did not have to qualify for this tournament. Fast on the counter and unified after years of internal division, watch out for talented midfielders Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi. But they cannot call upon prolific Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema. The French Football Federation FFF said he would not be picked after being investigated for his part in an alleged plot to blackmail Les Bleus team-mate Mathieu Valbuena, who did not make the squad. Well, there are three of them in France - only Scotland missed out - plus the Republic of Ireland. It is going to get crowded too, because England and Wales are both in Group B, along with Russia and debutants Slovakia. Don't expect much work to get done when England and Wales play each other - that match in Lens will be shown live on BBC One, kick-off 1400 BST, on Thursday, 16 June. Roy Hodgson's England have a good young team but doubts persist about their defence. They breezed through their qualifying group with a perfect record of 10 wins, while confidence was further boosted with March's impressive win away at world champions Germany. Wales have got Real Madrid star Gareth Bale and plenty of heart. Chris Coleman's side reached their first major tournament in 57 years after losing just once in qualification. Northern Ireland might have numerous players from England's lower leagues but they finished top of their qualifying group, losing just one of their 10 matches. Striker Kyle Lafferty could not get a game for club side Norwich during qualifying he has since been loaned to Birmingham but he scored seven crucial goals in nine games for his country. With the 24-team format offering hope to traditionally less-successful nations, five countries have taken advantage to secure their European Championship finals debut. Northern Ireland and Wales, of course, are two of them. Slovakia, who have been drawn alongside England and Wales in Group B, have qualified for the first time as an independent state. A 1-0 win against Spain showed the 2010 World Cup qualifiers can mix it with Europe's elite. Beware England and Wales. Albania have never been near a major finals, but edged out Denmark - the 1992 champions - in their qualifying group thanks to a shock win in Portugal. Oh, and because they were awarded a 3-0 win in Serbia by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after a riot. With a population of roughly 330,000 comparable to Coventry and only 21,508 registered players, Iceland are unsurprisingly the smallest nation to ever qualify for the finals. How did they do that? By beating the Netherlands - 1988 winners and three-time semi-finalists - home and away during qualifying. The Dutch, for the first time since 1984, will not be there. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who was voted the world's second best player behind Argentina's Lionel Messi in the 2015 Ballon d'Or vote, heads a star-studded cast. Ronaldo will be leading Portugal's challenge, while Wales hope his club-mate Gareth Bale - the world's most expensive player - can transform his impressive La Liga form onto the international stage. World Cup winners Germany boast a host of stellar names who have impressed in previous tournaments, most notably Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Muller plus Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos. France's challenge is set to be driven by energetic Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, who is still reportedly courting the attention of several English Premier League sides. Belgium are not short of star quality either. Premier League pair Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne will spearhead their quest for a first major tournament win, but the Red Devils are without injured captain Vincent Kompany. And Sweden superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 34, will be hoping to illuminate an international tournament for what could be the final time. The Netherlands' failure to qualify leaves Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben watching from home, while his club-mate Franck Ribery was not named in the France squad, despite suggestions he was considering ending his international retirement. The tournament's 51 games will be staged at 10 locations across France, including new stadiums in Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon and Nice. The opening match - between France and Romania on 10 June - and the 10 July final will be played at the Stade de France in Paris. Building the new venues and renovating historic grounds such as Marseille's Stade Velodrome has cost 1.6bn euros 1.2bn - modernisation which was necessary, organisers say, because France did not fully capitalise on hosting the 1998 World Cup. Vibrating stands, floating roofs and adjacent slag heaps - read BBC Sport's venue-by-venue guide In March this year, the International Football Association Board IFAB ratified a host of revisions to the laws of the game in an attempt to remove inconsistencies and meet the needs of the modern game. The changes came into effect on 1 June, so will apply for Euro 2016. More than 90 revisions were made, but these are some of the key changes Kick-off Previously, the ball had to go forward from kick-off but the rule has been changed to allow it to go in any direction. Pre-match red cards Players can now be sent off before a match gets under way, although they can be replaced by another player in the match-day squad. Leaving the pitch after treatment If a player is injured in a challenge resulting in a yellow or red card, they no longer have to leave the field and can have a quick assessment or medical treatment. This change is designed to prevent situations where a team would be temporarily down to 10 players. The end of 'triple punishment' A professional foul inside the area will now normally result in a yellow card for the offender, and not a red. This is to end the so-called triple punishment of penalty, dismissal and suspension, which was seen by some as excessive. There are exceptions for when the offender will receive a red which include holding, pushing or pulling and violent conduct. Goalline technology, already established in the Premier League and elsewhere, will be used at Euro 2016. Yes. But you had better be quick. Most of the group games - including all of England's matches - are sold out. However, as of 9 June there are tickets available to watch Wales and Northern Ireland, plus other games involving some of the smaller nations. There are also tickets available for the opening game between France and Romania - at 395 euros each. Find the latest ticket details on Uefa's official Euro 2016 website Each of the 10 host cities will have official Uefa fan zones. The fan zones will have a giant screen for showing all of the matches throughout the tournament. The biggest will be in Paris, where up to 90,000 supporters can gather on the Champ de Mars - in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. You won't miss a kick. The BBC and ITV will bring audiences closer to the heart of the action than ever before with extensive coverage of Euro 2016. The BBC will showcase 26 live matches on TV and streamed online within its 140 hours of programming, including highlights on BBC One, BBC Two and the Red Button plus 24 days of coverage on Radio 5 live. The BBC's Euro 2016 digital service will feature live broadcasts of all BBC games, commentary and live text coverage of every game featuring in-game highlight clips, on-demand highlights of every goal, breaking news, exclusive features and expert analysis. ITV will be home to 26 live games across ITV1 and ITV4, which will be simulcast live on the ITV Hub.

It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network. A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a victory over Islamophobia, and says London is breaking new ground. The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think, it says. Qatari daily Al-Sharq says Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor. Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe. With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims. History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. Not to mention that ConstantinopleIstanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim, he says. Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, former co-chair of the UK Conservative Party, and Business Secretary Sajid Javid congratulated Mr Khan and pointed out their similar backgrounds. Bus drivers are clearly the new Etonians quipped writer and conservative activist Tim Montgomerie, referring to the elite public school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Goldsmith. In France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says two images of the United Kingdom faced each other in this election The exemplary success story of Mr Khan's life and the billionaire's son, Mr Goldsmith. In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility, she told the paper. It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side. Finally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.",

Sale have moved home games back to Friday nights for the upcoming season. I think there is some rebuilding to do because I think people in the early days of moving have had a pretty poor experience, Cotton told BBC Sport. That could be queuing up on a motorway, couldn't get away from the stadium, couldn't buy a drink at the ground. Listening to the things we're going to do to change that, if people come down from now they will find a very different experience. The infrastructure is still well away from where it needs to be but there are plans to develop that. Cotton, 69, a former England and British and Irish Lions prop returned to Sale - a club he served as both a player and director - after Simon Orange's takeover of the Premiership side in June. He has promised to be active in his role, despite his commitments with his clothing business. What I really want to see is a very strong north of England club that can compete at the highest level, he added. That is my motivation for giving up the precious thing that I have got, and that is my time. I think what was lacking before was that the board weren't very often represented at games home and away, and I think that is very wrong - board members will travel to away games and home games. One of the standout announcements from Sale's new 10-man board was that director of rugby Steve Diamond will have a seat on it. However, Cotton insists there will be no conflict of interest with a member of the coaching staff also working as a director. It will put no strain whatsoever on the relationship, we're here to support him, Cotton continued. We'll be working very closely with Diamond to make sure we can achieve the ambition which we all hold - if we went down we'd still be with them. Diamond also confirmed they are close to signing a new full-back and are still looking for another player to add to their backline, with former Bath and London Welsh winger Nick Scott on trial with the club.",

    "input": "Russia's CG effects and the brilliance of Australia's singing were not enough to defeat jazz artist Jamala. Russia's Sergey Lazarev had been the bookies' top tip for days, possibly because his song was so similar to 2015's Swedish winner - with innovative staging and a slick song to match. But Ukraine stole past Russia and Australia under the radar, with the new voting system providing a huge surprise at the 11th hour when Jamala was crowned as winner. She is the first Crimean Tatar to perform at the contest, and her song, 1944, could not have been further from Eurovision's usual fare. It deals with Stalin, Crimea and claims of ethnic cleansing. Jamala dedicated it to her great-grandmother and her five children, who were deported by Soviet troops from Crimea in 1944. Simon Bennett, head of the International OGAE Eurovision fan club, told the BBC that former Soviet countries that would normally vote for Russia had sent it a message by voting for Ukraine instead. Political songs are not allowed at Eurovision, but 1944 was permitted because it was based on historic fact, rather than current politics. BBC Music reporter Mark Savage wrote in February that Ukraine's 2004 Eurovision winner, Ruslana, had said the song 1944 had struck a chord over current circumstances in the region. This song... is precisely what we are all suffering in Ukraine today, she said, referencing Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014. Jamala simply said after her win I want peace and love for everyone, adding at the press conference I was sure that if you talk about truth it really can touch people. But John Kennedy O'Connor, broadcaster, author and Eurovision expert, was not happy with Saturday's result. I'm disappointed that a dirge about genocide and delivering a pointed slap in Russia's face has won this year, he told the BBC. This contest should never be a political platform and I'm almost angry that it's been turned into one, despite the very clear rule book on the matter. He said that while third place was an excellent result, the Russians must be sick as parrots at the moment. Alasdair Rendall, president of the Eurovision fan club OGAE UK, said immediate reaction to Jamala's victory was mixed. Many people admired her strong voice and the impressive visuals on show, he told the BBC. However many are already saying it won due to the strong political message it carried rather than its musical quality. As for Australia, Bennett said it was neutral and easy to give your votes to while O'Connor said it was time for them to go away and start AsiaVision now, referring to a song contest for Asia Pacific countries. And at the other end of the leaderboard, hopes for the UK's Joe and Jake were dashed when they came third from bottom. Rendall felt the result was totally undeserved and Bennett was distraught for them. But O'Connor added The fact that their single is not in the UK top 100 after a month plus since its release says it all really. Joe and Jake told the BBC they had given it their all and sent huge congratulations to Jamala. The new voting system also got a mixed reception, with Bennett saying it was a disaster that destroyed the atmosphere' while Rendall said it had really ramped up the tension. It seems that the only thing everyone agreed on was the show itself. Congratulations to Swedish TV for putting on one of the most impressive, exciting and high quality Eurovisions ever, said Rendall.",

But the Universities and Colleges Employers Association said the walkout was disappointing given the very good pay offer. Unions representing university support staff are balloting on the offer, with strike action possible in the autumn. UCU says its members have suffered a real-terms pay cut of 14. since 2009 and complains the squeeze on staff salaries has come as university leaders enjoyed hefty increases. A 1.1 pay offer is an insult to hardworking staff, especially in light of the 5 pay rise vice-chancellors have enjoyed while holding down staff pay, said general secretary Sally Hunt. Industrial action which impacts on students is never taken lightly, but members feel that they have been left with no alternative. If the employers wish to see a swift end to this dispute, and avoid further disruption, they need to come back to the table with a much-improved offer. Summer exams are still running at some universities, though many have finished. A spokesman for the employers anticipated only minor impact and minimal student disruption. Even for examinations which are still taking place at some higher education institutions, more than nine out of 10 report that a no to low impact is anticipated, said the spokesman. We would like to see the UCU consulting its members on the final offer. The employers say the offer is at, and, for some, beyond, a limit of affordability for higher education institutions and the very best offer that will be available this year. They maintain the weighting of the offer means the worst paid university staff will get a rise of more than 5. They say they have also offered talks on zero-hours contracts and on improving lower pay for female academics. But UCU says it rejected the 1.1 offer as it was only a marginal improvement on the original 1 on which it had balloted members. Ballots of university support staff represented by Unison and Unite are also under way on the improved offer, with both unions recommending it be rejected. Any action would take place during the autumn term, said a Unison spokeswoman. UCU is planning strike rallies in Staff are also working to contract from Wednesday - refusing to set extra work, cover for absent colleagues or work overtime.",

Jurors found the fans who died as a result of the 1989 crush were unlawfully killed. The families also complained about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police. They called on the home secretary to put the force into remedial measures. It is understood the proposed 'Hillsborough Law' would seek to place a further onus on those in public office to cooperate positively with investigations. The families were told about developments in two ongoing criminal investigations into the disaster at the meetings with the home secretary, which were held in Warrington. Theresa May has previously praised the dignity and determination of the victims' relatives. Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said I myself for the very first time felt - I'm sure the families did as well - that at last there's a home secretary that's actually listening to them. The home secretary has met some Hillsborough families before, but this is the first time that she's spoken directly to them since the inquests ended. Theresa May spent several hours in Warrington, meeting separately with the two main groups of relatives. The atmosphere was said to be heated, with some of the families complaining directly to her about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police during the inquests. Some relatives asked for assurances that there will be criminal prosecutions, and I'm told that they wanted to make sure that the home secretary personally understood the emotional toll that the two-year inquests have taken. Although the Hillsborough families welcomed the jury's finding of unlawful killing, they know that many months of uncertainty lie ahead before they find out whether criminal trials will follow. The Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed that 19 people have refused to assist with their probe into the conduct of officers from West Midlands Police, which investigated the tragedy. The watchdog has now handed files on suspects to the Crown Prosecution Service in its largest-ever inquiry into alleged criminality and alleged police misconduct. The IPCC has contacted 258 officers and staff members involved in the investigation into the tragedy and a total of 161 statements have been taken. The watchdog said Our intention remains to submit full files of evidence to the CPS by the turn of the year to enable decisions to be made on whether any individuals should be charged.",

He said that when added to the last monitoring round it means the executive has allocated an additional 200m to health in 201617. Health accounts for about half of Stormont's departmental spending. Last week, Health Minister Michelle O'Neill said her department needed significant additional funding to meet growing demand. When asked on Tuesday if any of the money would be allocated to waiting lists, Ms O'Neill said she would make her decisions on the allocations of the additional resources as soon as possible within the next few days. So how will the money be spent? At this stage there is little detail. However, from the health minister's statement it seems that the money will go directly to unscheduled care which includes emergency departments. It will also be directed to those areas within hospitals which often experience bed blocking - when patients cannot be discharged as there is nowhere for them to be cared for in the community, including in their own homes. Read more. Other reallocations include 30m to schools with 5m of that for special educational needs. There is also 25m for roads maintenance and building schemes and 20m for further education. Mr Ó Muilleoir said there have been no new spending cuts despite pressure on budgets as a result of the Westminster austerity agenda. A large slice of the money which has been reallocated is 30m which had been set aside to mitigate cuts to tax credits. However, the money is no longer needed for that purpose after the chancellor reversed his plan to cut tax credits.",

    "input": "A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world. For that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks. There have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability. There are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term the stability of the commercial banks and swings in exchange rates. With the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due. Central banks can address that by lending them extra money liquidity. In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review. Other central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed. What if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs? There are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank ECB, and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed. The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently. With sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves. In the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets. So if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value. Conversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency. Further action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that. Currency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week. The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however. Interest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising a rate rise to prevent a fall. Both options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks. Further quantitative easing QE is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon, perhaps from the Bank of Japan which does not want to see the yen gaining value. Interest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently at 0.3 far below the Bank's target 2. Another risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago. Those earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market. Some observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive. The likely timescale for these options varies. In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period. The ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.",

    "input": "This was the end of the road for Wales in France but the 'Red Wall' - as Wales' players have dubbed their supporters - was still roaring its encouragement at full volume. Wales' momentous campaign was halted by a clinical Portugal side but, watching their team play their first semi-final at a major tournament, this was no occasion for fans to feel deflated. This was a moment of mutual adoration between a team who have established themselves as Wales' greatest, and their unwavering supporters. The bond between Wales' players and fans has been one of the defining features of Euro 2016, a symbiotic relationship that has propelled the country's football to new heights. As well as the anthem, 'Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau', and a repertoire of hymns, the Welsh chant of choice during this tournament has been 'Don't Take Me Home'. There was a poignancy to its airing in Lyon, for it has been a dreamlike existence for Wales fans in France. With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships. But Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite. There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long, said Coleman. We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that. Wales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed. It is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home. With every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium. He saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him The messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack. Despite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making. In the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection. Hal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu. There was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off. From a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players. Gareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football. For all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success. The vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends. Even when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best. These genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football. The death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side. Captain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal. My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today, he said. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him. Speed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of There's only one Speedo heard at every game. A friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not. Succeeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud. Coleman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey. Absent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait. The current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success. The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves, he said. We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack. Wales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup. Planning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement. Just as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff. Returning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.",

Sheila Mackie who set it up said The imposing scale of The Yomper needs space and adequate distance to be fully appreciated, and the visualization of the part in the major campaign that the statue represents couldn't be achieved in an interior space. Conservative-led Portsmouth City Council also voted to express a clear preference that the statue remain where it it is.

The taoiseach said Brexit talks should consider that a clause in the Good Friday Agreement could result in the calling of a referendum. In his remarks to reporters on Monday at the annual MacGill Summer School in Glenties, County Donegal, Mr Kenny said the triggering of a border poll required clear evidence of a majority of people wishing to leave the UK and join the Republic. He added It may be, in the eyes of some, a fanciful theory but who knows what happens in 10, 20 years time? Adams responded by calling for all parties supporting a united Ireland to discuss how best this can be achieved. In the context of the north being dragged out of the EU by England, there is now a greater opportunity to achieve this, he said. North Antrim MP Mr Paisley said Secretary of State James Brokenshire and his predecessor, Theresa Villiers, had both ruled out holding a referendum. It's not going to happen, he said. We all know in the next nine months Enda Kenny is not going to be taoiseach. So, he's really just being mischievous., Mr Paisley added.

    "input": "Ms Evans, who is currently suspended from UKIP, said she would very much like to run but a handful of people at the top had ensured she could not. Ms Evans' six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute - claims she has dismissed - means she cannot stand. She said she would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage. Ms Evans said UKIP needed to break free of its hard-right image and set itself firmly in the common sense centre-ground and also conduct some internal reform. The leadership contest has been prompted by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, saying his political ambition has been achieved. In a statement in Westminster, Ms Evans, who had been touted as a possible successor, said I'd very much like to run in that election. Unfortunately there are a handful of people at the top of UKIP who, for whatever personal reasons of their own, have made quite sure I can't. She claimed the party rulebook had been abused to suspend her to prevent her from representing the party in May's London Assembly elections and the upcoming leadership contest. Her six-month suspension handed down in March came after an internal disciplinary meeting found she had publicly criticised a fellow candidate and held herself out as a party spokeswoman without authority. Ms Evans - who has always rejected the claims against her - lost a High Court bid to overturn the decision. In the statement, she said I have to face up to reality, there's no way they're going to allow me to put my name on the ballot paper... I've now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP. Ms Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that allows, and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this, but she said the support from members had made her more determined ever not to give up on UKIP. She also said that with the right leader, the sky was the limit for the party. Endorsing Lisa Duffy, a district councillor for Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, Ms Evans said she was the best chance UKIP had to change, to grow and to thrive. She said UKIP needed a clean break from the past to become more like a political party than just a rugby club on tour. Under Ms Duffy's leadership, she argued, the party would be more united and consensual. Prior to her suspension Ms Evans wrote UKIP's 2015 general election manifesto. She was axed from her policy role in the party in-fighting which followed Mr Farage's unresignation after the general election. Mr Farage has denied her ban was due to criticism of him.",

    "input": "Relieved that the giant telecoms company would not be broken up, they piled into the shares, sending them up 3 in early trading. BT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons. She said complications with land deals and BT's giant pension scheme meant there were practical obstacles to a break-up that would delay the process several years. It's the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom's thinking. BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about Â40bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about Â10bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap. Senior sources at the company say that about 80 of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off. Separating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won. Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband. BT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners. This holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king. It also carries an echo of the golden shares held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards. BT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles. If they prove too much at odds with BT's own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.",

Devon and Cornwall Police conducted a search of the area but have not found the drone or operator. Insp Dave Meredith called it an incredibly concerning incident. Latest on the drone near miss, and other stories from Devon and Cornwall The close proximity of the drone to the passenger aircraft shows a complete disregard by the operator for public safety and we are appealing to the public for information to help us track down this reckless drone operator, Insp Meredith said. A spokeswoman for Cornwall Airport Newquay confirmed a drone had flown within the air traffic zone adjacent to the final approach to the airport as the plane flew in from London Stansted carrying 62 passengers. Although on this occasion there was no danger of collision, Air Traffic Control ATC reported this incident to the police as the drone should not have been flown in that area without ATC clearance and posed a potential danger to incoming flights, she said. A spokesperson for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said Airspace proximity incidents, whether involving two aircraft, or a drone and an aircraft, need to be fully investigated to establish the level of risk involved. The UK Airprox Board, which investigates airspace proximity incidents, said it had not received any official report of the incident yet. Flybe said it would work closely with all relevant authorities to help identify the perpetrators of any activity which could jeopardise passenger safety. Operators of any small unmanned surveillance aircraft must not fly them within 50m 164 ft of any vessel, vehicle or structure which is not under the user's control, unless they have obtained permission from the Civil Aviation Authority, according to the Air Navigation Order 2009.

The 23-year-old joined record-breaking Sir Bradley Wiggins, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy to beat the world champions. That was just surreal, it feels dreamlike said the Cardiff rider. Media playback is not supported on this device We've been in situations like that before when we've been so close and have lost so to pull it off now is unbelievable. He had previously won silver medals at the 2015 and 2016 World Championship - this year to the Australian team - but Doull earned Olympic redemption to add to the four Welsh silver medallists in Rio. I've dreamt of this moment for so long, added Doull. It's what gets you out of the bed in the morning. I've pictured crossing that line first and winning the Olympics and to finally be here and do it, it's just surreal. It's a culmination of four years of hard work. Swimmer Jazz Carlin, rower Victoria Thornley and rugby sevens players Sam Cross and James Davies had already enjoyed podium finishes before Doull secured Wales' seventh gold in the last three Olympics. Wales had not won an Olympic title in 36 years when Nicole Cooke stormed to women's road race gold in 2008 - the first Welsh cycling medal ever at an Olympics. But since Cooke's win in Beijing, Wales have won three more cycling gold medals - and could win a fifth on Saturday when Elinor Barker will help the British world record holding women bid for team pursuit gold. Doull - who started cycling at the Maindy Fliers club in Cardiff like Thomas and Barker - had helped the Great Britain team to lower the world record in their heat demolition of New Zealand. But Team GB were quickly behind in Friday's final as Australia led by 0.7 seconds at the halfway mark, before GB reeled them in and then pulled away in the final 500m to win the 4km race by 0.83 seconds - in a world record time of three minutes, 50.265 seconds. Doull's team-mate Wiggins became the first Briton to win eight Olympic medals - five golds, one silver and two bronzes - as GB won a third successive team pursuit Olympic title. It gives you such confidence....you've got Brad on my right behind me and I've got Burke and Ed down below me, said Doull. It's Burke's second Olympic title in his discipline, it's Ed's third and he's the most decorated Yorkshireman, so he keeps telling me, so to have that calibre of team is just massive and it gives you such confidence.",

He was second fastest in the individual pursuit and seventh in the elimination race with three more events on Monday. Becky James broke the women's sprint Olympic record in qualification and is in Monday's quarter-finals along with fellow Briton Katy Marchant. Cavendish, 31, began his campaign with a hard-fought sixth-placed finish in the scratch race, after Denmark's Lasse Norman Hansen, the London 2012 Olympic champion and Roger Kluge took the top two spots by gaining a lap on the field. In the individual pursuit, Cavendish recorded a time of four minutes 16.878 seconds and caught reigning world champion Colombian Fernando Gaviria Rendon in the process. That temporarily gave the Manxman the outright lead, before Hansen set a new Olympic record of 414982, beating Sir Bradley Wiggins' time set in 2008, to win his second event in a row. However, Hansen dropped from first to sixth overall after he was the first rider to fall out of the elimination race which sees the rider in last position at the end of every second lap ejected from the race. Cavendish was looking comfortable as other riders dropped out but he was ejected, despite not being the last rider over the line, when he overtook a rider while off the inside of the track, and was awarded seventh place. France's Thomas Boudat, the 2014 world champion, leads on 106 points, two more than Italy's Elia Viviani who won the elimination race, with Cavendish third on 96 points. The fourth event - the time trial - starts at 1421 BST on Monday, before the flying lap and points race events. Wales' James won a silver medal in the keirin on Saturday and maintained her good form on Sunday as she set a new Olympic record during the sprint qualification. James recorded a time of 10.721 seconds to beat the 10.724 set by fellow Briton Victoria Pendleton at the 2012 Olympics in London. That saw James become the fastest qualifier and she comfortably beat Olga Ismayilova of Azerbaijan by a margin of 0.165 secs to move into the quarter-finals, which take place from 1400 BST on Monday. Marchant also advanced in style as she defeated Canada's Monique Sullivan after posting the second fastest qualification time. Australia's defending champion Anna Meares was beaten by Lithuania's Simona Krupeckaite but won a repechage race to reach the last eight.

    "input": "It is the second successive time the area has been at the bottom of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation SIMD, which is published every four years. Statisticians rate almost 7,000 areas in Scotland by standards including income, employability and health. Lower Whitecraigs in East Renfrewshire is classed as the least deprived. Glasgow has 56 of the 100 most deprived areas, down five on 2012. Edinburgh has six, up two on four years ago. The 10 most deprived areas in Scotland The 10 least deprived areas in Scotland Renfrewshire Council, which covers the area including Ferguslie Park, said a long-term plan to change the area's fortunes was already under way. Council leader Mark Macmillan said The council has adopted an innovative approach to tackling poverty, recognised as leading the way in Scotland - and the SIMD stats are based on data from last year which does not fully capture the impact of that. The figures show the overall picture for Renfrewshire has improved and we believe we are making a difference on the ground. In the four years since the last SIMD figures were released, Renfrewshire has seen a 10 real-terms drop in the cash coming our way from Holyrood. The deprivation issues affecting Ferguslie and similar areas are long-term and deep-rooted - there are no easy solutions but through our unique approach, we believe we are on the right track. The Scottish government said the figures showed why Scotland needs a government committed to tackling deep-seated deprivation, poverty and inequalities. Communities Secretary Angela Constance said This will not be an easy job while we do not have the full levers of power, but I am determined we take on the challenge of making a generational change for those areas that have been in poverty for too long. In the face of continuing UK government welfare cuts, an austerity agenda and attempts to take Scotland out of Europe, this will continue to be a long-term challenge. She added We are spending Â100m protecting people against the worst effects of welfare reform and every pound spent on mitigation measures is a pound less that can be spent on lifting people out of poverty. The Scottish Conservatives said the figures should be a wake-up call to the SNP government. Equalities spokeswoman Annie Wells said There are many causes of deprivation - poverty, family breakdown, drug and alcohol abuse, low educational standards and poor health and we now need a new approach. Powers need to be devolved from the Scottish government to enable cities and city-regions to work more closely together to regenerate and redevelop their local economies. Scottish Labour's deputy leader Alex Rowley said If we are serious about cutting the gap between the richest and the rest we need to fully understand the picture of poverty in Scotland. These numbers are an important start - and they show a Scotland which remains too unequal, and further SNP cuts will only make it worse. The most deprived communities in Scotland will suffer more because of hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts to schools and local services, whilst our health boards are faced with millions of pounds of cuts because the SNP aren't giving our NHS the resources it needs. Scottish Greens spokeswoman Alison Johnstone MSP said If we're to boost incomes, employment chances and health, we need to see greater ambition from Scottish ministers and local authorities. Yes, the Westminster government's continuing agenda of cuts plays a part, but we cannot let that stop us. We can push further on a real Living Wage across our economy, and we can boost people's health by committing to a major programme of housebuilding and energy efficiency measures, along with better public transport and cycling and walking infrastructure. Analysis by Reevel Alderson, BBC Scotland Home affairs correspondent The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation SIMD is published every four years. It provides the government and local authorities with a considerable amount of information aimed at helping them tackle the problem. The index breaks Scotland down into 6,976 datazones, effectively small postcode areas, and ranks levels of deprivation there on seven criteria. These are income, employment, health, education, housing, access to services and crime. Overall scores are then provided for each datazone. But that is not the full picture. The statisticians say deprived does not just mean poor or low income. It can also mean people have fewer resources and opportunities, for example in health and education. One area may score well on educational outcomes for example, but have poor health and access to services. The Scottish government says this allows effective analysis for targeting of policies and funding where the aim is to wholly or partly tackle or take account of area concentrations of multiple deprivation.",

    "input": "The British Transport Police said the move was a proportionate response in the face of a mounting terrorism threat. Specially trained officers will begin carrying the stun weapons over the next few weeks. It brings the Scottish force into line with their counterpart in England, where Tasers have been used since 2011. The weapons are used to incapacitate suspects through the use of an electric current. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Alun Thomas said This decision is not based on specific intelligence of any criminal behaviour or imminent threat, but will allow us the option to deploy Taser devices where, in the course of their duty, an officer needs to protect the public or themselves by using force. The current threat to the UK from international terrorism remains 'severe', meaning an attack is highly likely. Recent terrorist attacks across the world are a stark reminder that the threat from terrorism is a genuine risk, and it is important that we keep our security measures and operational tactics under constant review. Officers south of the border fired the Tasers eight times during 2015, according to a reply to recent Freedom of Information request to the force. In one instance, police used a weapon against a man armed with a large knife - a move which undoubtedly prevented people from being hurt, according to Mr Thomas. He said In our assessment, the introduction of Taser devices in Scotland is a proportionate response and provides an additional option for our officers to consider when confronted with a genuine threat to themselves or the public. By way of example, in December last year, police deployed a Taser device against a man armed with a large bladed knife, preventing him cutting the throat of stranger who he had targeted at random at Leytonstone station, east London. Undoubtedly the use of the Taser device in this incident prevented even further harm to the travelling public. We believe that the public in Scotland deserve the same level of protection as people elsewhere on the rail network. British Transport Police said they reached the decision on Tasers following detailed discussions with Police Scotland. Scottish Ministers have also been briefed. The force refused to reveal how many officers would receive the training required to carry Tasers for security reasons. Ch Supt John McBride, divisional commander for the Scotland, said Taser use by officers would be monitored. Every time we unholster it, it will be subject to review, he told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme. It will be subject to internal review by our own specialists, but also we have agreed with the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner that where there is a discharge and serious incidents involving Taser then we will refer ourselves to the Pirc for them to review the circumstances of the case and if necessary carry out an investigation.",

    "input": "The 80-year-old, a champion of the Doric dialect, was a compere and producer of variety shows before branching out into broadcasting. He has presented the Scottish dance music show Take the Floor since the early 1980s. BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie said Robbie is one of Scotland's most recognisable voices. Robbie, explaining his broadcasting philosophy, said I like to think that I am broadcasting to a lady in the top tenement in Glasgow at the same time as I am chatting to a lady in a croft. Thousands of listeners tune in to Take the Floor on Saturday evenings. But Robbie has decided it is now time to step down from the show - and this weekend will be his final programme as permanent host. Born in Dunecht in Aberdeenshire in 1936, he admits that when he first entered broadcasting he was initially slated for his accent in some quarters, and was just a rough and ready country loon. Since then his work has been recognised with an MBE, and he was also inducted into a hall of fame by the Trad Music Awards. His career has included stints on BBC Scotland's Beechgrove Garden and presenting televised sheepdog trials. As well as his broadcast work, Robbie has been a regular commentator on the Highland Games circuit - including the famous Braemar Gathering which is attended by The Queen and members of the royal family - and a much-travelled concert compere. He has written books on Scottish dance music and Scottish country dancing, and has written a newspaper column in Doric. Robbie, who turned 80 in May this year, prepares for Take the Floor at BBC Scotland's Beechgrove Terrace base. Robbie said of the future I am taking a break, that is for sure. He added with a smile But, as they say, I am a wanted man. I hope sincerely you have not heard the last of this Doric voice. Mr MacQuarrie said Robbie is one Scotland's most recognisable voices and, over the years, he has been like a close family friend for many of our listeners. A passionate supporter of traditional Scottish music, Robbie has, over more than three decades, shared his in-depth knowledge and his infectious enthusiasm with generations of Radio Scotland audiences. I'd like to thank him personally, both for his work with Radio Scotland and also for his passionate commitment, championing Scottish traditional music across the country. Although we're grateful that he'll continue to work for us on one-off broadcasts in future, we wish him well as he prepares to Take the Floor for the final time. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was sad the broadcasting legend was stepping down from Take the Floor and wished him the best. Robbie said It has been 35 years of top-class music. From the great masters of the past to present-day performers, Scottish dance music continues to be a vibrant scene. So the time has come for me to hand over to a younger presenter Gary Innes and wish the Take the Floor team aw the best. He added I would also like to thank the many hundreds of musicians, whose music we've featured, and the audiences in halls at our recordings across the country who have provided a great atmosphere for the show. I'll be looking fur ye all and aw the best. Robbie, who is married to Esma, concluded It's been 35 years of sheer pleasure. Robbie's final Take the Floor will be broadcast on Saturday 17 September at 1900.",

Sales jumped from 9.4bn to 10.5bn, an increase of 11. The group's clothes can now be bought online in around 40 countries, it said. Inditex operates eight brands in 90 countries including PullBear, Massimo Dutti and Bershka. How Zara's founder became the richest man in the world - for two days Chairman and chief executive Pablo Isla emphasised the firm's investment in technology, saying the firm had expanded its online stores to 11 new countries in the period. It also launched mobile phone payment in all its Spanish stores, with the objective of extending the service to other countries. This will encompass online apps for all of its brands and a specific app for the whole group called InWallet. Mr Isla said Both our online and bricks-and-mortar stores are seamlessly connected, driven by platforms such as mobile payment, and other technological initiatives that we will continue to develop. Tom Gadsby, an analyst at Liberum, said the firm's online drive was important. I expect over the years they may find they don't have to open as many stores to maintain their strong growth rate as the online channel will become increasingly important, he said. And while Zara is available in many of the territories in which they operate online, most of their other brands aren't readily available outside Europe online. So there is a big opportunity there for them to expand online into new territories. The company also said it had benefited from steady economic growth in Spain, where Inditex gets about a fifth of its sales. That country's clothing market grew at an average of 3 in the three-months to the end of July, according to the Spanish statistics agency. All of the group's brands increased their international presence during the period, with 83 new stores opened in 38 countries. In a call with analysts, it said it would open 6-8 of new store space over course of the year. The firm's strong performance sets it apart from European rivals HM and Next, which have blamed unseasonal weather for below-forecast results this year.",

    "input": "Leroy Fer gave the hosts a first-half lead when he steered the ball home from close range at the back post after Baston Borja's knockdown from a corner. Roberto Firmino levelled shortly after half-time when he headed in from Jordan Henderson's cross. Milner netted the winner six minutes from time after Firmino was fouled. The Liverpool midfielder's goal was just reward a dominant second half from his team, who have now won four Premier League games in a row. It was, however, a little cruel on Swansea, whose spirited performance has probably bought Guidolin a little more time to turn things around. The Swans are above the relegation zone on goal difference and have not won in the league since the opening day of the season. But the club's owners had indicated before the game that the manner of performances would have as much of a bearing on Guidolin's future as the results. Liverpool arrived in south Wales on a high, winning their past three league games and scoring 11 goals in the process. Despite his side's fluency in attack, manager Jurgen Klopp had expressed concerns about the Reds' fragility from set-pieces, and his fears proved well founded as they fell behind in scrappy circumstances. Rattled by their opponents' energetic pressing, Liverpool conceded a corner and, from it, Swansea's 15m record signing Borja headed across goal for Fer to turn the ball in from a yard out. The ragged visitors could have conceded another had Borja not been so wayward with a free header - and Liverpool fans may have feared another hard lucky story, akin to their only defeat of the season at Burnley, on 20 August. However, the visitors were vastly improved in the second half as they recaptured their recent impressive form and equalised thanks to more unsteady set-piece defending, as Firmino headed in from close range. Klopp's side dominated from that point and, after they were initially thwarted by dogged Swansea defending, they eventually struck when Angel Rangel pushed Firmino in the back and Milner calmly converted the penalty. In stark contrast to their high-flying opponents, Swansea entered the game in the midst of a torrid spell chairman Huw Jenkins described in the match programme as the hardest of his 12 years at the helm. Guidolin's future remains in the balance, with his side just one point above the relegation zone and without a league win since beating Burnley on 13 August. His players responded to his plight superbly, harassing Liverpool with a high-octane first-half display. However, they were overwhelmed after the interval and were powerless to stop Guidolin suffering a third successive league defeat for the first time in his tenure. His position is now as uncertain as ever. Although Swansea's owners have started compiling a shortlist of potential successors in the event of Guidolin's sacking, they indicated beforehand that the Italian would be given time to turn the club's fortunes around. Media playback is not supported on this device After yet another game without a win, though, that time may be running out for Guidolin. Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin The players gave me a good answer. Our relationship is good. There is no problem between me and my players. I don't know about the future. It's not my decision. It's just for me to prepare for the game and the team. I know the situation. It's a possibility. The important thing is to prepare with patience. Media playback is not supported on this device Before the game I saw the new owners Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan just to say 'hello'. I don't know if in the next day there's meeting. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp I thought we could have done better in the first half. Our body language was not good, we were static and it was easy to defend against us. We are not as good as we should have been. You have to show why we are here. We showed a reaction, were more organised, clear in all situations and we deserved to win. Of course I am happy we have had two or three brilliant games in a row. If Milner is our top scorer at end of the season with penalties, I have no problem with it. All is good. The performance was not perfect but it was good enough.

    "input": "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Russian air force would continue its support of the Syrian armed forces. He also urged Washington to deliver on a pledge to separate moderate Syrian opposition fighters from terrorists. US Secretary of State John Kerry warned the US was on the verge of suspending talks with Russia over Syria. It's irrational, in the context of the kind of bombing taking place, to be sitting there, trying to take things seriously, he told a conference in Washington. There is no notion or indication of seriousness of purpose with what is taking place right now. The Russian foreign ministry said a US refusal to co-operate would be a gift to terrorists. The US and Russia have been negotiating for months to try to secure a cessation of hostilities but the latest truce collapsed last week after only a few days and attacks on eastern Aleppo have since intensified. The US warned on Wednesday it would end talks on military co-operation unless Moscow stopped the bombing. The recent cessation deal was meant to lead to joint Russian-US air strikes on so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham formerly known as al-Nusra Front. However Russia has complained the US has not done enough to separate the more moderate rebel groups, which it backs, from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Many of these groups have formed a strategic alliance with the more powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and fight alongside it. Despite growing tensions between the two nations, Mr Peskov said Russia remains interested in pursuing talks with the US in an effort to resolve the crisis in Syria. His comments echo a statement from Moscow, which insisted it would send diplomats to Geneva to discuss ways of normalising the situation with the US. US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that national security agencies were reviewing all options to try to end the Syrian civil war. He said President Barack Obama had asked all of the agencies to put forward options, some familiar, some new, that we are very actively reviewing. When we are able to work through these in the days ahead we'll have an opportunity to come back and talk about them in detail, he said. Meanwhile Turkey has said it will work with Russia on putting in place another ceasefire after the previous agreement collapsed. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara we are more than ready but emphasised that nations have to try harder to find a political resolution in order for an agreement to be effective. Aleppo has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the partial truce deal disintegrated a week ago. Some 250,000 people are trapped in the east in appalling conditions, under siege from Russian-backed Syrian forces. UN aid chief Stephen O'Brien has warned that Aleppo is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Mr O'Brien, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the UN Security Council Aleppo had descended into a merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe unlike any we have witnessed in Syria. The US has accused Russia of taking part in strikes on civilian targets and possibly committing war crimes - charges Russia has strongly denied.",

I'd like to think, the way we've played, we'll have a few in there, Young told BBC Sport. I know Jones has had contact with some of the players on a regular basis - we have got a number in the mix. Jones will also name a trimmed down party of approximately 35 for a training camp in Brighton next week. The final squad before the autumn Tests will be named on 26 October, and with injuries to Wasps' James Haskell and Harlequins' Jack Clifford, England currently have a void at open-side flanker. Northampton's Teimana Harrison started there in England's last match - against Australia in Sydney as Jones' men wrapped up a series whitewash - and is set to be named in Friday's squad. But the Wasps' pair of Guy Thompson and Sam Jones have impressed so far this campaign. There has been a lot of talk about Guy with his form at the start of the season, added Young. And everyone knows what a big fan I am of Sam Jones - his work-rate is phenomenal. Hooker Tommy Taylor has been excellent according to Young, while Wasps number eight Nathan Hughes is likely to be involved having qualified on residency in the summer. Scrum-halves Joe Simpson and Dan Robson have also both stood out in partnership with fly-half Danny Cipriani. Meanwhile, Leicester flanker Will Evans has been touted as a possible solution to England's number seven conundrum. Evans starred for the Junior World Championship-winning Under-20s in the summer, and followed that by being named in an England training squad in August. It is understood Evans is set be named in the EPS on Friday, but his director of rugby at the Tigers, Richard Cockerill, says the 19-year-old should not yet be thrust into the international arena. Will is not ready to play international rugby, Cockerill told BBC Sport. The reality is he has started one game for Leicester, and before that he was playing for Ampthill in National One. Eddie sees him as a project player and is keen to get the transfer from 20s to the senior group - and his potential is huge. He is a great young player, who is going to be very, very good. But at the moment but he is not ready yet for Test rugby. However, Cockerill feels differently about Mike Williams, the Zimbabwe-born Tigers forward, who is a firm part of Jones' plans, and could even make his England debut come November. Mike Williams has a little bit more experience, Cockerill said of the 24-year-old. Given the opportunity he is ready to step up to Test match level today.",

    "input": "Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course, Mr Kirby said, admitting that this is not a decision that was taken lightly. He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy. Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the US suspension of the talks, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said We regret this decision by Washington. Washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around Aleppo. After failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else, Ms Zakharova said. She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home. The US also said that it would withdraw personnel that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the Joint US-Russian Implementation Centre. However, the two sides would keep talking about counter-terrorism operations in Syria to avoid unnecessary clashes.",

    "input": "Inciting people to harass others online, known as virtual mobbing, could also result in court action, under new Crown Prosecution Service guidance. The director of public prosecutions said it means the CPS would prosecute just as if offences occurred offline. But she stressed this did not mean prosecutors could stifle free speech. The new guidance aims to help police identify online crimes more easily. It also highlights those who post people's personal information, such as bank details - known as doxxing. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said The internet's not an anonymous place where people can post without any consequences. People should think about their own conduct. If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline. However, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test. One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times. The abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name. The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid they even set up a website in her name. The woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter. Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author. It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech it's hate speech, she said. She added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures. The incidents are now being investigated by police. Kevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work. He said Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police. It's been a nightmare it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it. Mr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad. With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything, he added. The CPS says it will use considerable caution before charging those posting grossly offensive material. The changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability. The CPS also said underage sexting between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve exploitation, grooming or bullying may lead to legal action. Ms Saunders told the BBC If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it, she said. Asked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said We probably need to think about it. A new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015. The public policy statements on hate crime will be subject to public consultation for 13 weeks.",

Anthony Reuben, from BBC Reality Check, had this answer The BBC does not give financial advice, but here are a few things to bear in mind... The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar reflects the views of investors about the relative strengths of the two economies. Since the Brexit vote in June the pound has fallen about 18 against the dollar on the judgment that growth is likely to be stronger in the US than the UK and that UK interest rates are falling while the next movement in US rates is expected to be upwards. But it's always possible that something could happen to change that view - there is a presidential election in the US in November, for example. The outcome of that could make a considerable difference to the exchange rate. You do not necessarily have to put all your eggs in one basket - there is also the option to hedge your bets and buy half of your dollars now and half of them just before you go, as long as you are not going to be hit by extra charges for carrying out two transactions. It is always worth shopping around when buying currency - avoid buying your currency at the last minute at the airport. There are plenty of comparison sites online that will help you get the most dollars possible for your pounds, even if it is fewer than you would have got a few months ago.

    "input": "Bids have been submitted by Abellio, Arriva, KeolisAmey and MTR for the next Wales and Borders franchise. The successful bidder will have to make a slice of its profits available to be reinvested in the railway. They will also be responsible for delivering a major upgrade to the rail network in and around Cardiff as part of the Metro scheme. A contract will be awarded in early 2018. The four bids are being assessed by Transport for Wales TfW, a Welsh government-owned company, as part of what ministers said would be an ambitious and creative not for profit model. Officials said the four preferred bidders were the only four to come forward for the contract. The Welsh government has set out its ambitions for the Metro but it will be up to the bidders to propose how it will operate, as well as drawing up plans to build a new rail or tram system. Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent This is the first time that the Welsh Government has awarded a rail franchise. It did not have the power to do so when the all-Wales franchise was awarded to Arriva. The model this time will focus on what level and quality of service the various bidders can offer. They will be asked to outline what they will do to drive up the numbers of passengers taking trains and buses across Wales. While the Metro for south Wales will be part of the bid, the company's proposals will also be scrutinised in terms of how they will affect all geographical locations. Whichever company wins will have a cap set on how much profit they can make. We do not yet know at what level that will be set but once that is passed remaining profit will go to the body responsible - Transport for Wales - to be reinvested in public transport in Wales. That cap will be for negotiation. Each company is expected to put together its own particular mix of heavy rail, bus and possibly light rail. The preferred contractor is expected to be known by early 2018. Negotiations are underway with Network Rail about handing over responsibility for the track on the core Valleys lines to the franchise holder. The current franchise is run by Arriva Trains Wales which gets a subsidy from the Welsh Government of between 150m and 180m a year. Rail privatisation laws stop the Welsh Government giving the contract to public sector bodies. The Welsh Government has lobbied for more powers, but said its requests have been turned down in Westminster. Officials said in time TfW may evolve to take on more responsibilities, similar to Transport for London. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said new trains, quicker journeys and modernised technology were priorities for the franchise. We now have four highly skilled, experienced companies entering the next, competitive phase and I am keen to hear more from them about what they can offer Wales and how they can deliver on our plans for integrated public transport, he said. Over the next 10 years I envisage significant strides in the delivery of our public transport network including the electrification of the Swansea, Valleys and north Wales lines, a South and North Wales Metro and widespread structural improvements that are already in the pipeline.",

    "input": "Media playback is not supported on this device Since dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better. But that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal. Another way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope. But not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again. Fury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock. When I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe? Hardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people. Fury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice. The repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional After pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old. Jess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey. Sometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain. Media playback is not supported on this device In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a witch hunt against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought. Before and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts. As such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right. But the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in. When Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media newspapers and major broadcasters had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers. Fury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations. How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship? In threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs? If you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned. I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy, says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous. Fury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them. However, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable. When you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him. On Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control BBBofC met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, cocaine is against the law of the land. There was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November, as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring. It should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds. Even if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them. It might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it We can't have a belt held hostage. One can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused. Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him, was Hatton's grim assessment. He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good. But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same. Fingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.",

I hear the pitch is good, a nice big pitch suits the speed in our team and our intensity. The technical area goes right out to the end of the pitch, but you might need a taxi to get back to your staff. This will be Rodgers' second taste of the Old Firm derby and his experience of the fixture got off to a great start with a 5-1 league victory at Celtic Park last month. It was a brilliant performance by the players in every aspect, he recalled. Obviously this one is on a neutral ground, but we'll be looking to have a similar performance. We'll be prepared and focused. We know it's going to be a tough game. We anticipated that the last time. Rodgers is also aware Celtic's visit to Hampden last season in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers ended in defeat. The last experience there wasn't so good for Celtic, he said. But it's a different team with a different mentality and we'll look to take that mentality into the game. Rodgers lost two semi-finals in his time at Liverpool and is aiming to make it third time lucky at the club he joined in the summer. You have to perform - that's what's important and if you get little bit of luck along the way then hopefully you'll get the result that you want. said the Northern Irishman. So, for us, it's really looking at our performance level, which in the main has been at a really high level. My focus is always on my own team and, if we impose our style of play, it can give a lot of problems to opponents. Unlike predecessor Ronny Deila, Rodgers would not be drawn on this semi-final being a step on the way to a potential domestic treble. It's very, very difficult to achieve, he said. There's been great managers here in the past that haven't achieved that. But it's the first competition where we've a chance to win a trophy and I've always said that it's a priority for us because it's the first one. Our idea was to qualify for the Champions League, which we did, to make a good start in the league, which we've done, and then look to get to the League Cup final.

It is not a surprise because I thought he retired too early, said Lennon. Sometimes you can make these decisions and then think you have still got plenty to offer. Brown's return to the fold means that on Wednesday he is almost certain to be included in Strachan's squad for the World Cup qualifier against England at Wembley on 11 November. Lennon told BBC Scotland I think last season his injuries took a toll on him and we didn't see the best of him but certainly this season he is looking far more like himself again and playing very well, which will be an asset to Scotland. I think his presence around the dressing room and training ground and certainly on the pitch will be felt if he is not there. He is only 31 and there is plenty more to come from him. I thought his decision was premature anyway. Lennon does not envisage any issues with Brown returning to the squad for a game he believes Scotland can win. I don't know how it would affect the dynamic of the group but certainly I think it would pep it up, he added. It was a poor performance and result in Slovakia and it might just give them the wee jag they need, having a player of that quality back. The England game is one I think they can win. It will be a British style of game and there won't be anything the Scottish players will be surprised about. Scotland assistant manager Mark McGhee, meanwhile, looked forward to the team benefiting from Brown's leadership, saying by example and his voice and influence, he makes other people better. McGhee added Scott Brown is someone who I would imagine, when England are looking at our squad and our team, would prefer him not to be playing. He looks as if he has coped better with combining the European and league campaigns. He feels good about himself and he can do both at this stage. I would imagine he has been revitalised by Brendan Rodgers, the Celtic manager. I think the manager has given him a new lease of life. He would have made his original decision in an honest way. But now he has looked at it and decided it was clearly the wrong decision. If the other players feel that Scott Brown gives us a better chance of winning the game, they will be delighted to have him back.",

    "input": "The imagery, released by US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor and taken on 31 October, shows how almost all the buildings at the airport, on the southern outskirts of Mosul, have been razed. Runways have also been damaged, with wide trenches carved into them and rubble placed along their lengths, Stratfor's analysis says. Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged. About 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants. Government forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts. The damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles. However, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says. IS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km 43 miles south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July. By comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair. Mirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport. Stratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport. Along with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base. In contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS. After the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them. However, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings. Satellite imagery released last week, showed how IS had constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the northern Iraqi city.",

But critics say it could put more people out of work as employers might not be able to afford the higher wages. The government says it will consult on the issue, but hopes to introduce a minimum wage within two years. Announcing the rate, which was proposed by a panel of advisers, the country's deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa said We are now a step closer to finalising discussions on the national minimum wage. All social partners will now decide what their take is. He said the panel was not endorsing the proposed figure as a living wage, but wanted to set a minimum payment for workers. Wages are politically sensitive in the country, where the official unemployment rate is close to 25. One employment expert reckoned the figure was only about a quarter of the amount needed for the upkeep of a typical South African working-class household. Prof Chris Malikane of the University of Witwatersrand told a Johannesburg radio station You would need 12,000 rand to sustain a basic household. The African National Congress, South Africa's ruling party, supported the proposal calling it credible and clearly supported by clear evidence. However, the Economic Freedom Fighters, the country's third largest political party, said the plan favours business at the expense of workers. It called for a higher minimum wage of at least 4,500 rand. South Africa faces a possible downgrade to sub-investment grade by credit ratings agencies next month, with concerns remaining over violent wage strikes. Moody's currently rates South Africa two notches above subinvestment grade, with a negative outlook, while Fitch and SP Global Ratings have it just a step above junk. However, Mr Ramaphosa said We have made tremendous progress on the labour instability issues,",

That makes it the second-highest Thanksgiving debut of all time, behind Disney's Frozen, which took 93.6m 75.3m on its release in 2013. Some observers have said that Moana and its merchandise are appropriating Pacific Island culture. Disney withdrew a children's costume promoting the film after activists branded it brownface, or mocking of their culture by stereotyping. The costume, a full-body suit with brown skin, traditional tattoos, grass skirt and bone necklace, represented the character Maui, considered a demi-god and ancestor by many Polynesians. Disney said it regretted any offence. JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them fell to second on the US chart, taking 65.8m 53m. Gossip surrounding Brad Pitt's marriage break-up failed to spark a huge amount of interest in his World War Two romance Allied, which also stars Marion Cotillard. It took 18m 14.4m over the long weekend, having cost 85m 68.5m to make, landing in fourth spot behind Doctor Strange. Kyle Davies, Paramount's head of domestic distribution, said the film appealed to older audiences but noted those don't storm the theatres on weekend one. I think they're going to take their time, he added. Warren Beatty fared worse - his first film in 15 years, the 1950s Hollywood comedy Rules Don't Apply, took just 2.2m 1.7m. The film is Beatty's first directed feature since 1998's Bulworth. Bad Santa 2, released 13 years after the original and again starring Billy Bob Thornton, did a little better, taking 9m 7.3m.

Five other people survived the crash, which killed 71 people. Colombian officials say evidence is growing that the plane ran out of fuel. Miguel Quiroga, the pilot of the British-made Avro RJ85 aircraft, had been warned by an official at Santa Cruz airport, in Bolivia, where the plane took off, that he might not have enough fuel, Bolivian Deber newspaper said. But, despite the official's concerns, he went ahead with the flight to Medellin. The country's authorities have not yet commented. In a leaked tape, the pilot can be heard warning of a total electric failure and lack of fuel. The flight missed a planned refuelling stop in Cobija, on the border between Brazil and Bolivia, because the airport did not operate at night, Brazil's O Globo newspaper reported. The pilot had the option to refuel in Bogota, it said, but headed straight to Medellin. Bolivia's President Evo Morales said he would take drastic measures to determine who was responsible for the crash. On Thursday, the country's aviation authority suspended the operating licence of charter airline LaMia, which was part-owned by the pilot and two other aviation officials. Colombian police released a video in Spanish with the moment crew member Erwin Tumiri was rescued alive. It showed him conscious, screaming for his colleagues. He is in hospital and reports in local media suggest he may be discharged this weekend. The other crew member who survived, Ximena Suarez, was said to be in good condition in hospital. The four other survivors were still in intensive care. Neto's father, Helam, said on Facebook that news of his recovery was giving the family renewed hope and faith. My son is getting better and better. He has just undergone surgery on his leg and doctors say he will return to football, he said. We shall continue praying because we still need his discharge from hospital to see him closely. Doctors said 24-year-old goalkeeper Jakson Ragnar Follmann would not lose his left leg, after having his right one amputated. Defender Alan Ruschel, 27, had spinal surgery, but his movements were not affected, they added. Journalist Rafael Henzel was listed as stable. The bodies of the Brazilian victims were flown out of Medellin on Friday. Many of the victims were players and staff of Chapecoense, who were due to play in the final of the Copa Sudamericana against Medellin team Atletico Nacional. In the squad's home town of Chapeco, in southern Brazil, temporary structures have been set up in the football stadium for an open-air wake on Saturday. Some 100,000 people are expected to attend. The plane's flight recorders are to be examined in the UK. A full investigation into the crash is expected to take months.",

    "input": "Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation. Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders. The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems. Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation. Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered. However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority. Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was chronic. There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere, he said. It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months. When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice. Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds, he said. Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released. He said he would ask himself Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter. You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing. Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing. You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere, he said. Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available. We do still see people homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision, he said. I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't. But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen. A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence. It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.",

    "input": "Dr Waleed Abdalati told the BBC the that continued access to data is in everyone's best interest. Many US scientists are rushing to copy information onto servers outside the control of the federal government. They are afraid the Trump administration will curb access to climate and other research. The President-elect has blown hot and cold on the issue of climate change, having previously tweeted about global warming being a hoax. On Wednesday, one of his advisers compared scientists who support the mainstream view on global warming to flat-Earthers. There was an overwhelming science that the Earth was flat and there was an overwhelming science that we were the centre of the world, said Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the Trump transition committee, on CNN. We get a lot of things wrong in the scientific community. Now at the Co-operative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, Dr Abdalati served as Nasa's chief scientist in 2011, for two years. He says it is too early to tell if this type of rhetoric from the Trump team will be backed up by action against scientists working on climate issues. I do think that when it comes to access to federal databases, and information that the taxpayers have paid for, there would have to be a tremendous paradigm shift to actively take steps to make those data unavailable, and I think doing so would be an enormous disservice to the citizens of this country and to the world in general, he said via email. I do think that the scientific community, educators, members of the private sector who rely on these data in their businesses, and others will need to make clear that continued access to these data, which have been paid for by the taxpayers, allows their full value to be realized and is in everyone's best interest. Other researchers are taking a more pessimistic view on the question of data access and are encouraging colleagues and students to make copies. Prof Robert Paterson, from the University of Texas, Austin, says that he learned this the hard way under the administration of George W Bush, another president cool on climate. Within a month of coming into office the EPA website went down for three weeks and when it went back up stuff wasn't available anymore, Prof Paterson told BBC News. If history repeats itself with another administration that is basically a naysayer to climate change science, I would say it would be prudent for folks to do what they can to keep as much as they can on mirror sites. Other scientists are concerned about nominations to key government areas such as former Texas governor Rick Perry at Department of Energy DoE and Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt at the EPA. Both have heavily criticised the agencies they now lead. Attempts by the Trump transition team at the DoE to obtain a list of all those employees who had worked on climate change have provoked anger as well as fear. I was horrified by the report with regard to Department of Energy scientists being named. We must stand up to that and I have said so. We are all DoE scientists in that regard, said Dr Kevin Trenberth who has been a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC is a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR. That is a pretty chilling action by an incoming administration - the rhetoric suggests that revenge is a valid response to people who disagree with you, said Prof Robert Paterson, The Energy department has refused to comply with the request and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was not authorised. Many researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations. Flooding is a fact of life in Texas and the frequency with which we're seeing it is noticeably increasing, said Dr Shannon Van Zandt, at Texas AM University. A lot of the tools that have been developed by Federal agencies have been designed to help communities predict the changes that they're going to see and if that is restricted we would lose the ability to help people understand and incorporate it into the decisions that they're making both at the local level and at the state policy level. But some in this field believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking. Marcel Crok is a Dutch science writer who doesn't support the scientific consensus on climate change. He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this. Mr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise. Mainstream scientists, he says, rely on models that are over sensitive to carbon. He expects this to change under Trump. He said What the field is trying to do is prove that the observational estimates are wrong and that the models are still right, and in my opinion this is exactly the problem. They should be more open minded, they should be open to the idea that the models are wrong! I hope that under a Trump regime at least there would be more funding, because if the funding agencies ask these kind of questions they can stimulate research in other directions than proving that the models are right all the time. The idea that aspects of climate research, supported by a minority, should now gain funding at the expense of the majority view, is dismissed by those in the field. It is not all spun, it is not all one side or the other, said Prof James White from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado. This is good unbiased information, it would be a real shame if that data is turned off. Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook",

    "input": "Russia is fuming, in the words of BBC Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg, but US politicians have not minced their words either. Here is a taster of what's being said and shared. Tweet by Dmitry Medvedev, Russian prime minister Sad that the Obama administration, which started its life with a reset, ends it in anti-Russian death throes. The outgoing American administration led by Barack Obama, while accusing Russia of all deadly sins, trying to accuse us, among other things, of the failure of its foreign policy initiatives, as you know, without grounds, has brought forward additional accusations that the Russian side - at state level - was interfering with the US electoral campaign, as a result of which the Democratic candidate lost. Yesterday the US administration, without presenting any facts, any evidence, announced a new wave of sanctions against Russia. Maria Zakharova, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, in a post on Facebook headlined 'Obama's Coming Out' The people who have lived eight years in the White House are not an administration but a group of vindictive, unimaginative, foreign policy failures. Today US President Barack Obama admitted this officially. Most surprising of all is that after failing to record any achievements in the international arena in the history of his presidency, the Nobel laureate has managed to sign off not with a flourish, but a blot... Today America, the American people, has been humiliated by its own president. Not by international terrorists, not by enemy troops. This time it's Washington's chief delivering the slap in the face, ramping up the workload for the incoming team... Zakharova says Jews backed Trump Such actions of the administration in Washington are the demonstration, unfortunately, of an unpredictable, even aggressive, I can say, foreign policy. We think that such decisions of the acting administration, which is supposed to be in office for three more weeks, pursue two aims finally irrevocably? spoiling US-Russian relations and, obviously, having an impact on the foreign policy of the future administration of the president-elect Donald Trump. What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes. And what we are saying today is, in response to and in order to impose consequences for the Russian government's increasing harassment and aggression toward our personnel in Moscow, and, of course, their malicious cyber-activities, interfering and an effort to interfere in our election process, we are imposing consequences. They the Russians are trying to destabilize democracy all over the world, not just here. It's just not about pulling for Trump, it's bigger than that. They're trying to break the backs of democracies. Here's what we should do. We should tell the Russians that on no uncertain terms, you interfere in our elections, we don't care why, we're going to hit you and hit you hard. I'm going to introduce sanctions, they will be bipartisan that names Putin as an individual, his inner circle, for not only hacking into our political systems but trying to destabilize democracy throughout the world. We need to get to the bottom of this. We need to find out exactly what was done and what the implications of the attacks were, especially if they had an effect on our election. There's no doubt they were interfering and no doubt it was a cyber-attack. The question now is how much and what damage and what should the United States of America do? And so far, we've been totally paralyzed. Russia does not share America's interests. In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world.",

The 39-year-old told BBC Essex he would play in this year's tournament if his wife gives birth before his first-round game against Joe Perry on Monday. The only question I'd ask myself is if she actually went on the day, he said. Obviously it could happen and even now I still haven't got an answer to that question. I'd have to talk it over with my wife and see where we go. Bingham, the current world number two, said his wife has been supportive in wanting him to play at the tournament, which gets under way on Sunday. He continued She's had two previous babies and she's been in labour for 10 hours, so obviously if that's the case then I've got a bit of time to 'pot some balls and hurry up' sort of thing. As I say, we need to talk the next day or two because we thought it'd be out by now.

    "input": "The end of last year saw growth across several sectors of the economy, but there are concerns about rising prices, skill shortages and falling sales. Manufacturers reported their highest growth in new orders for nearly three years, with export demand still strong. In retail, there was also a return to optimism - though only just, and despite profitability being squeezed. In tourism, firms reported improving visitor numbers in the final quarter of the year, but falling sales revenues. Responses to the survey, carried out for the Chambers of Commerce by Strathclyde University economists at the Fraser of Allander Institute, were more positive than the economic figures published on Wednesday. The Labour Force Survey and the Gross Domestic Product figures showed weakness in the Scottish economy, while covering an earlier part of 2016 than the Chambers' survey. While the GDP assessment from the Scottish government has seen a sharp contraction in the past year, the Chambers found a more positive picture, with growth in private commercial contracts. However, there are warning signals survey, with tourism companies having difficulties in finding skilled recruits. Retail firms flagged up rising prices. Construction is expecting an investment dip. The weakest of the five sectors covered was finance and business services. More firms in that large part of the economy saw employment fall than saw it rise. But on balance, firms say sales revenue is expected to increase. Neil Amner, chairman of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce economic advisory group, said Our latest economic data shows that many Scottish businesses will have a successful 2017, with business optimism remaining positive for many sectors. This is good news for the economy, particularly as we continue to deal with international uncertainty and domestic issues including a rating revaluation and a potential divergence of Income Tax between Scotland and the rest of the UK. The overall business mood remains positive but firms expect business growth to be challenged by rising prices, tightening of cash flow and profitability, higher import costs impacted by exchange rates and a likely increase of inflation as the year goes on. On the converse side, exporters are continuing to report a healthy growth in trade, though perhaps not quite matching up to their initial expectations. Optimism could hardly be more finely balanced and anything that rocks the boat could change the glass from half full to half empty. Business success in 2017 will largely depend upon the ability of firms to manage costs and for consumer demand to remain strong in the face of pressures to real incomes.",

    "input": "Manor's operating company Just Racing Services has been in administration since 6 January, and FRP Advisory has been unable to find a buyer. Just Racing ceased trading on Friday, effectively ending the Manor team. The staff were sent home on Friday and told they will be made redundant by the close of business on Tuesday after the payment of January salaries. FRP said there was no sustainable operational or financial structure in place to maintain the group as a going concern. Joint administrator Geoff Rowley added the administration process provided a moratorium in the search for a buyer but no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form. It is not necessarily the end of Manor - a buyer could potentially still purchase the remnants of the team. But even if that were to happen, the move makes it much harder for Manor to make it to the start of the season in Australia on 26 March. The team's collapse leaves 10 teams - 20 cars - on the grid in Melbourne and comes just five days after the sport was taken over by US company Liberty Media and long-time commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone was removed as chief executive. Media playback is not supported on this device Manor started life as Virgin Racing in 2010 and has been through several guises in the intervening seven years. It previously went into administration in October 2014, and was only saved by current owner Stephen Fitzpatrick, the boss of energy firm Ovo, on the eve of the 2015 season. Fitzpatrick has said the decisive moment was the team's slip to 11th place in the constructors' championship as a result of Sauber's Felipe Nasr finishing ninth in the penultimate race of last season in Brazil. This cost the team in the region of 15m 12m in prize money. Manor were one of three new teams to enter F1 in 2010 after they were promised by then FIA president Max Mosley that a 40m budget cap would be introduced. But Mosley stood down as head of the governing body in 2009 after losing a fight with the teams over the plan and the cost limit was abandoned. All three teams have now collapsed. This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser Anneliese Dodds MEP has called for a European Commission investigation into the FIA and F1 following Manor's collapse. She said The collapse of Manor Racing could be the end of seven turbulent years for a team that brought highly skilled jobs to Oxfordshire. I am very concerned that this follows other job losses in small teams. Formula One Group, its owners and the FIA as a regulator really need to be investigated after this collapse. The unfair way in which prize money is allocated in the sport, permanently favouring the largest teams regardless of their finishing position, has seen many teams struggle to survive and ultimately reduced the number of cars on the grid. The European Commission must investigate the complaints it received last year from two F1 teams related to anti-competitive practices before even more highly skilled jobs are lost both in the South East and all around Europe. I will be writing to the Commission to call on them to take serious action on the way F1 is run, before a sport loved by 500 million fans is damaged beyond repair.",

    "input": "With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular. We were rehearsing in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show, she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far. She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam not one of his best songs proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ BOOM! And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ BLAM! BORN TO RUN! It led to the memorable headline America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring Justice 4 Mario Woods - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX. She raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic. For the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers. 1987's show was altogether more bizarre. A magician named Elvis Presto burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics. At the culmination of the show, the Prince of Prestidigitation performed an interactive magic trick pick a card, concentrate real hard while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses. It was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach. She arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous left shark. He was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves. It quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star. And when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend. Poor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob. Few ever believed that the wardrobe malfunction was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press. Nonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.

    "input": "Cotter will leave the Scotland job and be replaced by Glasgow boss Gregor Townsend at the end of the season. Strauss, who will start at number eight against Ireland on Saturday, says the Scotland players want to send Cotter out on a high. When people move on you want to give them a good send off, Strauss said. It does bring that little bit more of an incentive. You do try that little bit harder. You need emotion to play rugby and it does give you that little extra edge. Scotland have not won an opening day Six Nations fixture since the victory over France at Murrayfield in 2006. Their record against Ireland in the championship does not offer much cause for optimism either. Ireland have won 14 of 17 Six Nations matches between the sides. Moreover, Joe Schmidt's side have beaten South Africa, Australia and New Zealand since last summer, with Munster's CJ Stander a stand-out performer, and a player with whom Strauss is well acquainted. We shared a room at the Springbok camp for a week back in the day, Strauss said. He's a farmer from up north in South Africa and I'm more of a beach boy from down in the city in Cape Town. We get along well and he's a very nice guy. He's a very tough player. Even with the Bulls, I played for the Lions so there was a very big rivalry between our two South African teams. He was always one of the guys we watched out for. He's come over and he's done exceptionally well. Scotland resource coach Nathan Hines, who will follow Cotter to Montpellier in the summer, warned that Schmidt will have pinpointed every Scottish weakness ahead of the Murrayfield clash. He brings an unbelievable tactical awareness, said Hines, who played under Schmidt at Leinster. He goes through the other team with a fine-tooth comb and finds their weaknesses. That gives his teams confidence. I was across at the end of last year and spoke to him. The door is never closed with Joe, unless it is and he hasn't told me yet! He's an open guy and we had some good times with Leinster so I'm sure he'll give me a cheeky smile on Saturday before kick-off. They're very good at what they do. They find weaknesses and they exploit those weaknesses and make it very hard for you to play. It's about how we combat that and how we make it as difficult as possible for them to execute. Ireland captain and hooker Rory Best expects to wage a punishing set-piece battle with Scotland's inexperienced front-row. Edinburgh's Allan Dell, and Glasgow duo Fraser Brown and Zander Fagerson have just nine Test starts between them three each, but 100-cap Best warns their lack of international appearances will not make for an easy ride. When you get that two-three link that play together every week, train together every day, it helps a lot, he said. There's no doubt that will play into their hands. They're inexperienced if you look in terms of Test rugby as a combination but if you look at what they've achieved individually so far this season.to go to Welford Road and dominate the way Glasgow did and the way they've been performing, we've played against them provincially and it's a very tough task scrumming down against that Glasgow scrum. They form two-thirds of the front row on Saturday. We're under no illusions that it's going to be a tough ask. They're quality players.",

Ten shadow ministers were among 47 Labour MPs who rejected party orders to back it last week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said frontbenchers would have to quit if they defied the whip at the next vote. The draft legislation comes back to the Commons on Monday for three days of debate culminating in a vote on its third reading. Speaking on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry rejected a suggestion the party was hopelessly divided on the issue. She said she understood colleagues not wanting to vote in favour of invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins the formal departure process, but said We have said that we will not frustrate Brexit. We have got our instructions from the British people. We are democrats and the public have voted to leave the European Union. Labour will try to amend the draft legislation to secure what it calls a meaningful vote on the final deal struck between Theresa May and the EU, and to guarantee the status of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living elsewhere in Europe. Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as red lines. Ms Thornberry declined to say whether they were non-negotiable red lines for her party, and denied it was illogical to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected. There will need to be back channels, private conversations. There are many conversations going on now, she said. We are speaking to government, we are speaking to Tory backbenchers and we are trying to get a compromise that will work. One of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, missed Wednesday's vote, citing illness. Former Labour minister Caroline Flint criticised Ms Abbott, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday We used to have man flu, we now have Brexit flu that Diane has created hereâ it's about being part of a team. I think she holds one of the most important portfolios within a shadow cabinet. If she can't support the leader on this then she should go. But former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman defended Ms Abbott, pointing out she had earlier said on television she would back the bill so had already taken the flak on it. Among the rebels in last week's second reading vote were 10 members of the front bench, who would ordinarily be expected to step down after defying leadership instructions to back the bill. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that changes to his shadow cabinet would be announced in the coming few days. Asked if he should be lenient, he added I'm a very lenient person. Speaking later, he said he expected Ms Abbott to vote with the party this week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the shadow cabinet would decide how to approach Wednesday's third reading vote on the Brexit bill. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live that if a three-line whip was again imposed, any frontbenchers who rebelled will have to step down.",

The protest by the Stonehenge Alliance was staged outside a consultation event in London earlier. Highways England said it was working to find the best solution possible. The public consultation on its plans for putting the A303 into a 1.8-mile 2.9km dual carriageway tunnel runs until 5 March. Highways England says the move would cut congestion and improve journey times. The scheme has the backing of English Heritage and the National Trust. Speaking outside the Society of Antiquaries at Burlington House, Robinson suggested a longer tunnel. He said I think the proposal we are being offered is a really old-fashioned one. It assumes what needs to be protected is that little clump of stones. He said it was only over the past three decades archaeologists had begun to comprehend the wider significance of the site. That's a high-class Wiltshire Disneyland experience, he said. Once it's gone, we'll never get that back. If you were going to protect Buckingham Palace, you wouldn't put a tunnel in halfway down the Mall. The Stonehenge Alliance wants other options to reduce traffic to be fully explored. Spokeswoman Dr Kate Fielden said We want a genuine consultation with real choice. Both of Highways England's options involve huge and damaging new roadworks gouged into our most important ancient landscape. A spokesman for Highways England said We fully understand the cultural heritage of the site and one of the broad objectives of the scheme is to help conserve and enhance the World Heritage Site by removing the sight and sound of traffic and make it easier to reach and explore.",

    "input": "But there certainly should be. These are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer. It is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is. The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers, says Essilor. But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry. Gordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says This now allows the enlarged group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user. Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them. Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term, Mr Ilett adds. If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry. It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything they offer to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains, he argues. In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses, he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies they both have stock market listings the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was an undisputed leader with only 25 market share of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41 share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10 of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as a complex and extremely competitive market-space. Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros Â12.8bn, of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review. These are An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature, he said. We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance, he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide, the firm says. It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself. If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros. For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros. With cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further. Will customers benefit as well?",

Having made his screen debut in tsunami disaster movie The Impossible, he first appeared as Spidey in Captain America Civil War and recently finished filming for Spider-Man Homecoming. But Tom admitted the super hero role has its drawbacks. Ever since I was a kid I've wanted to be Spider-Man. It's been so fun, but my legs are in bits right now from spider poses after spider poses. So I'll be sitting down for the rest of the evening! It was perhaps inevitable that Meryl Streep's speech at the Golden Globes would come up at the Baftas. Asked about Donald Trump's response, supporting actress winner Viola Davis didn't hold back. Anyone who labels Meryl Streep an 'overrated' actress obviously doesn't know anything about acting, she said. That's not just directed towards Donald Trump - that's directed towards anyone. She didn't stop there. This is someone who is the master at her skill and she has lasted for 40 years in a very difficult profession, Viola continued. One of the things people have to know about this woman is that she is the most honourable, accessible human being you could possibly want to meet. Best actor winner Casey Affleck said he'd grabbed a word with Meryl Streep after the Baftas ceremony. She was taking pictures of people... and I told her how much her speech at the Golden Globes meant to all of us and how grateful I was that she did it and kicked in the door a little bit, he said. The Manchester by the Sea star said he hoped more actors would speak out. There is a big audience for these awards shows... and I have to say I'm very proud to be a part of the arts community. I don't always say some of the things I would like to say in those opportunities because there are people like Meryl Streep who say them much better than I can - and if they are going to be said it should be said very, very well because they are important. I'm a little bit wobbly, confessed Dev Patel a few minutes after winning the supporting actor prize for Lion. I really did not expect it, we have gone to so many awards ceremony and this one is where everything changed, on home turf with my family. Dev recalled how he had made his acting debut a decade ago on E4's teen drama Skins. I remember the first time I ever stepped on a film set, I never knew what a boom mic was, he laughed. My mum took me to an open casting of Skins after she saw an advert in Metro newspaper and 10 years on we are here at the Baftas - that is pretty amazing. Justin Hurwitz, who won the Bafta for his original music in La La Land, said that he'd written a title song that didn't end up in the movie. It was going to be in the middle of the movie but we nixed that, and then we toyed with using it in the end credits, and we nixed that at the last minute. And how about this? Another Day of Sun, from the famous traffic jam scene, was cut for many months before being put back in as the big opening number. Mel Brooks, who was awarded the prestigious Bafta Fellowship, was asked about whether he might write a comedy about Donald Trump. I'm not afraid of him, I don't think he's dangerous, said the 90-year-old writer, actor and producer. I think he's mostly an entertainer, a guy who wants audiences to love him. What I'm afraid of are all the guys around him, the people who whisper in his ears, like the people who whispered in George W Bush's ears and we got the Iraq War... I just hope that Trump stays the egomaniac he is, listens to no-one and then we'll all be safe. But if he believes these guys we're all in trouble. Mel was in a lighter mood as he plugged his new musical Young Frankenstein, which will open in London's West End this year after a run in Newcastle. I think, modestly speaking, it will be sensational, he chuckled. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Ulster Unionists want the election to be a referendum on how the Renewable Heat Incentive debacle was handled. But the focus has now turned on them following Mr Nesbitt's comments. Mr Nesbitt was asked about the decision of his senior party colleague Danny Kennedy to publicly distance himself from the remarks. He turned to Mr Kennedy, who was sitting behind him on the platform, and said It wasn't disappointing, it was actually quite reaffirming to know Danny was listening. The line brought laughter from other candidates and party members. Under questioning from journalists, Mr Nesbitt denied that he had any regrets or that he had made a mistake. What I have said consistently is vote Ulster Unionists and then for any candidate that you believe will do the right thing within your community, within your constituency and within the country, he said. He added that he wouldn't withdraw a word of what he had said and was thinking only of what what would happen after the election. The fact is, if we are going into Stormont Castle, it will be with a nationalist party, he said. Now, would I rather go in with Sinn FÃin or the SDLP? I would rather go in with the SDLP.

A union said the idea was terrible but families deserved to know the truth about funding. A Department for Education DfE spokesman said new funding plans would increase the trust's budget by 2.4. The Olympus Trust runs one secondary, one all-through school and five primary academies in South Gloucestershire, to the north of Bristol. In the letter Mr Baker warned parents of the unthinkable decisions the trust could be forced to make from September. These include shortening the school day because we cannot afford to staff lessons for the whole week. Other proposals are cutting teaching and support jobs within the schools, increasing class sizes and reducing the curriculum. The letter also says parents may be asked to make regular financial contributions to supplement school funding. Mr Baker said South Gloucestershire was one of the five worst-funded local authorities so had less reserves to draw upon. Beckie Morton, a parent of two daughters at Charlborough Road Primary School, is anxious about the impact any cuts will have on her girls, aged 10 and seven. She said It's shocking - I don't know what I'd do work-wise if they shortened the school day. If they do this, all that will be left is the lessons and no extra support for pupils. My eldest daughter suffers panic attacks and has received a lot of pastoral care - this will have a massive impact on her final year there. Natalie, who has a son attending at Bradley Stoke Community School, called the proposals diabolical. She said At the moment we are hoping to have a special needs support worker for my son and if they cut funding he won't have that. I don't blame the school, they are trying their best. In December, the government announced the biggest shake-up of school funding for decades. The DfE said the current system was unfair, opaque and outdated and the changes would see more than half of England's schools get more cash. We recognise that schools are facing cost pressures, which is why we will continue to provide support to help them use their funding in cost-effective ways, including improving the way they buy goods and services, soâŽ they get the best possible value.  Kevin Courtney, chair of the National Union of Teachers NUT, said schools were still facing an 8 reduction in spending power. He said All schools in England will have less money in real terms per pupil in 2020 than they do now. This cash they talk about doesn't keep pace with spending pressures on schools. The proposals Mr Baker has mentioned are terrible and none of them should happen, but parents deserve to know the truth about the position schools are in.

    "input": "Restoring the function of the organ - which helps control blood sugar levels - reversed symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments. The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were potentially very exciting as they could become a new treatment for the disease. The experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the fasting-mimicking diet. When people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning. There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Dr Longo said Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes. Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations. BBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo. He said During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg 4.4-8.8lbs. But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight. But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly. His blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers. He said The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat Peter Bowes Fasting for science Peter Bowes Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body Separate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why. However, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet. He told the BBC It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise. He said people could get into trouble with their health if it was done without medical guidance. Dr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes. People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Follow James on Twitter.",

Councillor Sally-Ann Hart said the council needed to act after the significant and unprecedented deaths. Families of the men who drowned said a lifeguard service could have saved their lives. Five men died during a day-trip to the beach last August. A month earlier, two others also lost their lives. The council said the beach attracted more than one million people each year. It said lifeguards would be present from the late May bank holiday until the end of the summer holidays to offer reassurance to visitors. Speaking after a council meeting on Monday night, Mrs Hart, the cabinet member for tourism, said Our thoughts remain with the families of those who lost their lives. The incidents were significant and unprecedented and we need to react to the changing circumstances. We not only need to protect the visiting public, but also the economy and livelihoods of our coastal tourism businesses. However, she stressed the importance of people from all communities across Britain being better informed on beach and water safety before they visit. She said The beach can never be completely risk-free but we are committed to investing in our beach patrol, the lifeguard service and working with other agencies to ensure visitors to the beach are aware of the dangers of the sea. Full inquests into the deaths are awaited. The council said it would act on any recommendations the coroner might make.

    "input": "Two snowsports enthusiasts got married at a Scottish ski resort before sliding off down a run in their wedding attire. Bridget and Jonathan Reid, from Moy, near Tomatin in the Highlands, tied the knot at Nevis Range, near Fort William, on Friday. The couple first's date six years ago was a skiing trip, so they decided it would be appropriate to get married on skis. Adventure photographer Hamish Frost took their wedding snaps. Bridget, who is a teacher, and Jonathan, who runs his own electrical automation company, benefited from recent snowfalls for their big day. They got married in full Highland dress, which includes a kilt, and white wedding dress surrounded by snow-covered mountain landscape. The white stuff had been lacking over winter, but last month's Storm Doris and recent spells of colder weather have helped with the operation of Nevis Range and Scotland's other outdoor ski centres. The newly weds said Over the last couple of years we have spent as many weekends as possible skiing the Back Corries at Nevis Range. We love the atmosphere, the friendliness of the staff and the amazing terrain for skiing. When we heard that we could actually get married there it was a no-brainer. The couple got married at the top of Easy Gully in a ceremony officiated by Halde Pottinger from the Humanist Society of Scotland. He was totally up for marrying us on skis and did an amazing job. He is currently trying to establish whether or not we are the first wedding actually conducted and vowed in skis - officiate and couple, said the Reids. We can't actually believe we are but there can't be many. We also managed to twist the arm of adventure photographer Hamish Frost, who came along to take photographs. The couple added The day could not have been better. Without doubt it was the best conditions of the year - with blue skies and fresh snow, we could not have asked for more. They thanked the staff of Nevis Range for a fabulous job making our day possible, and for helping in throwing a hell of a good party in the evening.",

    "input": "Media playback is not supported on this device The Olympic silver medallist accused the organisation of ageism and having zero regard for her welfare. She is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme. Houvenaghel told the BBC she felt vindicated by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures. The report said British Cycling sanitised its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment. British Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay sufficient care and attention to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview. Both Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling. Houvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture. A government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently. It is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies. Houvenaghel claimed British Cycling said it has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme. It said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings. The statement added Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling. Who else has spoken out? Houvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011. She retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury. Houvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time. Speaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was very traumatic and she felt torment at having no explanation for her last-minute omission. At the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional. He added I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that. British Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career and she was part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence, but was dropped in London 2012 based on her performance. Other elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling. Asked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race. There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities. It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative. Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012. Houvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age. I can certainly relate to the bullying, she said. For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012. They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them. After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right. Fourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is cut-throat but there are no excuses for crossing that line into bullying. Asked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals. It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through. But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.",

Dai Young's side are now guaranteed a place in the end-of-season play-offs, while Warriors are nine points clear of Bristol and only four adrift of 10th-placed Sale. Wasps director of rugby Dai Young It's a win and five points but there were very few areas of our game that pleased me. Worcester won nearly all the 50-50s and were first to react in terms of mind and our performance didn't match the five points. Christian was probably the difference, but I always thought that we could respond if we needed to as we probably had that extra bit of quality. It was a big message to us as we will have to be better against Leinster next week as they will match us for quality so we'll have to prove that we've got the belly for the fight. Worcester director of rugby Gary Gold We knew we had to put in an incredibly strong performance and we showed huge character in an absolutely outstanding effort. We are a good team and improving but we want to keep our feet on the ground, although I believe we've turned the corner. We defended very well but we conceded two tries to Wade, who is a world class finisher. If you don't get him first time, you end up chasing shadows.

    "input": "His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons. A few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head. Carrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election. Eyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front. Faizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital. I knew he was gone, Zarifa told me. A heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead. Faizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest martyr. By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan. Faizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day. The voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1 - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties. The soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with protests and provocation in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me. One report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds. Separatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the anti-people agenda of the Indian government. Disillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away. Why Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear. By all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire. Whatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy. A picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world, the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera. He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted former Indian captain MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor, a cousin told me, when I visited the family. Grief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn. My son, my son, where will I find you now? she cried, again and again. Then she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains. The blood of a martyr never goes waste, said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom from Indian rule. A brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy. I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit. Outside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness. They said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because they are our brothers and don't kill civilians and are fighting for freedom. More than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces. We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain, said Feroze Ali, a school clerk. Since February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape. The army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments. Recently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army. Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us, an army officer told me. The region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley. Kashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule. Many say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated. Militancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s. But young Kashmiris - more than 60 of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40 of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of becoming irrelevant, as a leader of an opposition party told me. This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people, says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher. India needs to be worried, very worried about this.",

    "input": "Tawel Fan ward at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire, was closed more than three years ago and a report found some patients were treated like animals. It has emerged that at least seven patients' families were told treatment may have contributed to their deaths. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said an investigation was under way. It acknowledged the quality of care provided could have been a contributory factor to the deaths of some patients. A review of mortality rates on the ward has never been published although it is understood it has been completed. Relatives of one patient told BBC Wales Today they were told medical care on the ward was inadequate. Correspondence seen by the programme included an apology from the health board to the family, who do not want to be identified. One letter said Experts found that there were problems in the health care which may have contributed to the death. It added that the board is very much engaged in a thorough search for the truth about the Tawel Fan ward. But the family were unconvinced lessons had been learned and said questions remained unanswered and, as far as they were aware, nobody had lost their job, let alone be prosecuted. The scandal of Tawel Fan pushed the already troubled health board into close supervision by the Welsh Government. It remains in special measures which costs Â5m a year. An initial report into what happened at Tawel Fan was published almost three years ago. Two more reports are due later this year. One of them, being compiled by the Health and Social Care Advisory Service Hascas, is expected to include details of a mortality review of Tawel Fan patients. But Geoff Ryall-Harvey, who leads the patient watchdog Community Health Council in north Wales, said it should be released as soon as possible. It may stop this practice elsewhere, he added. A Betsi Cadwaladr health board spokesman said We acknowledge that the quality of care provided could have been a contributory factor to the death of some patients. Whether this is the case will be established as part of the independent Hascas investigation, which is currently being carried out. In order to establish whether or not the quality of care contributed to any patients' death, every aspect of every patient's care has to be investigated. This is a complicated and time consuming process, but must be carried out in order to determine whether or not the care provided was a contributory factor to any patients' death. Every family involved in the investigation will receive an individual report detailing the care provided to their relative. These reports will also help inform the findings of the Tawel Fan investigation.",

    "input": "But one nation, Russia, was missing. For the first time in Eurovision history, the host nation barred another country's singer. That is because in 2015, in violation of Ukrainian border rules, Russia's Julia Samoilova performed in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia a year earlier. Samoilova suffers from a neural muscular disorder and has used a wheelchair since childhood. When the rumours began I might not go, I was so sad, she told the BBC in Moscow. I thought, how come? This was my dream. When the final decision was taken I didn't believe it. But unfortunately, this is the reality. I think it's a stupid reaction, Russian MP Vitaly Milonov tells me. They're even afraid of such a small girl to enter Kiev. Even before Ukraine's ban, Mr Milonov had called for a Russian boycott of Eurovision Eurovision became a disgusting socialist nightmare for all these left-wing parties with all their bearded women, or men, with these anti-Christian positions. I am sure that most conservatives in the world will never attend this festival. Because this is a festival of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is supposed to be a festival of peace and friendship but there is not much sign of either in relations between Kiev and Moscow. In eastern Ukraine, 10,000 people have been killed in three years of war a war in which Russia is directly involved through its military support for separatist rebels. Crimea remains a source of tension and Eurovision is the latest battleground. Since 2014, we've had a law in Ukraine that punishes people who illegally cross our border when they visit Crimea, says Ukrainian MP Olha Chervakova. Did Russia know this? Of course. Did Russia know that Julia Samoilova would fall foul of this law? Of course. In other words, entering her in the contest was a conscious provocation to create a huge political scandal. The ban created a huge headache for Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union EBU. Eurovision's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said in March that Ukraine's decision went against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values. In an unprecedented move, the EBU offered Russia the chance to take part by satellite from Moscow. Russia declined after the dramas of last year's Eurovision, Moscow was in no mood to compromise. Ukraine's 2016 winning entry, 1944, sung by Jamala, was about Joseph Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population. Russia had argued that Jamala's song broke contest rules for being of a political nature. When it won, Moscow cried foul and said there was politics at play. Now Russia seems determined to make not only Ukraine look bad, but the entire Eurovision Song Contest. When strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you and say 'we're not guilty' Recently, two Russian pranksters - posing as Ukraine's prime minister and his assistant - released online a telephone conversation they had recorded with a woman they claimed was EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre. If this is the voice of the EBU's top official, it is hugely embarrassing for the EBU, because the woman on the recording makes an astonishing admission about Ukraine's winning song I was just too late made aware of the song. If I would have been earlier, and I think it was on purpose, I would have not allowed the song to participate, to be very transparent. In a statement, the EBU said it would not comment on prank calls. But these are high-profile Russian pranksters, who once fooled Elton John into thinking he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Now our people don't trust Eurovision any more, one of the pranksters, Alexei, told me. People understand that any country can use their political goals to win, so it's not a fair contest anymore. Perhaps this is not just about a song contest? Or Russia's relations with Ukraine? Equating Eurovision with Sodom and Gomorrah and embarrassing the EBU appear part of a wider pattern of Russia trying to undermine Western institutions and Western liberal ideas. Russia now defines itself in its social and societal model against the West, believes Jan Techau of the Richard Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. The Kremlin explicitly portrays Russian society as a counter model to the corrupted West. They seem now to buy completely into the idea that whatever harms the West is good for Russia a classic zero-sum game. In the run-up to this year's contest, singer Jamala warned that we should expect more provocations from Russia because our victory hurt them a lot. Security in Kiev is tight ahead of the first semi-final. As for Julia Samoilova, instead of singing at Eurovision this week, she will be performing - once again - in Crimea. Another political message from Moscow, to Kiev and to Europe.",

But last year Local Government Secretary Sajiv Javid refused to accept the decision. Planning judge Mr Justice Gilbart ruled that Mr Javid's decision was fatally inconsistent and plainly deficient. The case will now have to be reconsidered. Mr Justice Gilbart, sitting in London, quashed the refusal, saying The secretary of state has performed a complete and unexplained volte-face in his assessment of the highways impacts of two proposals for development on the same site in Newmarket and has also failed to apply his own National Planning Policy Framework. The judge said There is on any view a requirement for more land for housing and other economic development in the Forest Heath District. Edward Stanley, the 19th Earl of Derby, brought the legal challenge with Moulton Parish Council and the Rural Parishes Alliance. The judge said local parish councils had for some time argued that growth in the area should not be dispersed among the rural parishes but concentrated in Newmarket. Newmarket Horsemen's Group and some others were concerned that development in the town may have an adverse effect on the horseracing industry that is based there and lead to increased traffic. A spokesman for Lord Derby said The secretary of state now has a second chance to determine the application. He should take full account of the significant benefits the planning application will bring to Newmarket when making a decision.

    "input": "Instead of fees rising to 9,250 per year in the autumn, Jeremy Corbyn is proposing a complete handbrake turn in saying that university tuition should not cost students anything. It's a bolder step than Labour's previous leader, who two years ago opted for a halfway house of cutting fees to 6,000 - and then was accused of pleasing no-one. This is Labour going for an all-or-nothing approach - asserting free education as a fundamental principle - and creating the starkest choice in university policy for two decades. It's a direct appeal to younger voters - with surveys suggesting that students are more likely to vote Labour. It makes the pitch that no-one should be deterred from university because of the cost or fear of debt. Labour has costed the removal of fees - and the reintroduction of maintenance grants - as being worth 11.2bn per year. And this is only England - because education funding is a devolved matter. There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further 500m per year. This would be covered by the 48.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments. But there are lower estimates. Labour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students. But the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around 7.5bn to 8bn. Labour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction. But they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments. The most recent figures show 76bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years. From this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the 10,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1. And the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors. Under Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government. But is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged? Universities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion. One of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates. The argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees. This year has seen a fall of 5 in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased. But the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration. Although wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest. Do students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects? Department for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned 10,000 per year more. Among younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at 6,000 per year. But the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade. Labour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters. A survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections. The survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote. The Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives. Is this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government? Could they really entirely scrap fees? There will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees. Germany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees. French undergraduates can study for low fees. In the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about 100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes. There are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton. And the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland. For England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.",

    "input": "According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission FCC was detected over the weekend. More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days. Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal. This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data. One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest. Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions, wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity. Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites. He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic. It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates, he said. He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway. For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time. And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added. Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days. Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service DDoS attack that led to downtime for the comments system. This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website. Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something, noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute. He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality. This is how people protest these days, said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments. He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it. However, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist. There are people that care about this issue a lot, he told the BBC. Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give the FCC an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.' The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.",

    "input": "As part of our fight against this, we have a very much underutilised tool - food. In BBC One's Doctor in the House, I try to help 34-year-old Emma Gleeson, who has been experiencing anxiety, depression and panic attacks for many years. She was 19 when she really began struggling with mental health. Following a severe episode of pneumonia, she ended up in intensive care in a coma. When she woke up she was petrified. She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks. During an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud. It is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers. Emma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day. One of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices. Despite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state. I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years, she said. Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health. I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume. I feel so much better and intend to keep this up. The evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing. A landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology. Plus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks. Unfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients. This has to change. Many of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up. When we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term. But, this can actually make things worse in the long term. The food you are eating is literally shocking your body. By changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks. She also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress. It has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health. Of course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional. There can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood. As a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you 1. Reduce sugar and processed foods Sugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise. Within two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall. At this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel h-angry as well - hungry and angry. Low and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline. This can have a negative impact on your mood. 2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats This is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders. Foods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish salmon, mackerel, anchovies, grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables. 3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts Tryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter. Eat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood. 4. Feed your gut bugs Some scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers. It is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis. The prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut. Best options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. You have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate. See how food can impact mental health on Doctor in the House, Monday, 2100 BST on BBC One.",

His 28-year-old nephew Alexander provided the donor kidney - a noble job as Cole described it. Cole has improved physically and has lost most of the weight he gained through his illness. And while there is still more work to do, Cole, who will be United's assistant manager for the return legends game against Barcelona at Old Trafford on 2 September, is looking forward to playing if a similar match is staged in 2018. He said I still get very tired but I can do a lot more than I was able to two years ago. If this game is played next year I want to be out there. Earlier this week, another former Newcastle and England striker, Alan Shearer, told the BBC he felt English clubs were a long way off being able to challenge for the Champions League. Cole agrees, saying From what I have seen in Europe, I am not sure any of the English teams will win it. They are miles apart. If you look at Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich, a lot of the players people are talking about Premier League clubs paying 50m or 60m for can't get in their teams. That tells you where they are at.",

    "input": "Dan Coats also told a Senate panel he did not think it was appropriate to discuss his conversations with the president at a public hearing. His comments follow a report that President Donald Trump asked him to derail the Russia investigation. The National Security Agency chief also declined to comment on the matter. Admiral Mike Rogers told a Senate intelligence committee on Wednesday he has never been directed to do anything illegal, immoral, unethical or inappropriate as NSA director. Mr Coats echoed Mr Rogers' statements as senators pressed the pair on their interactions with the president. I'm willing to come before the committee and tell you what I know and don't know, he said. What I'm not willing to do is share information I think ought to be protected in an opening hearing, Mr Coats told the panel. He is later appearing in a closed session before the committee on Wednesday afternoon. This Senate testimony by intelligence community heads was billed as the undercard to James Comey's appearance on Capitol Hill on Thursday, but it turned out to be a big letdown. Top intelligence officials in the US government have taken a bunker mentality when it comes to the investigation into Russian meddling in the US election, refusing to share details of presidential conversations in open Senate testimony. Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation, it seems, has the spooks spooked. That may come as a relief to a White House that has been buffeted by a seemingly never-ending stream of controversial revelations, from allegations that the president attempted to influence the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to reports of internal divisions within the administration. The president and his aides shouldn't breath easy, however. Although today's testimony was largely a dud, Mr Comey - no longer a government employee, thanks to Mr Trump - will have more leeway to discuss his interactions with the president if he so chooses. His former colleagues my have seen discretion as the better part of valour, but the former director isn't known for backing down from a fight. Mr Coats testimony comes a day after the Washington Post reported that he told associates Mr Trump had tried to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his ties to the Kremlin. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as fake news. The two intelligence chiefs joined acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify before the panel on Wednesday. The lack of answers appeared to frustrate both Democratic and Republican senators, who repeatedly pressed the intelligence officials on the Russia inquiry. Republican Senator Richard Burr, who chairs the committee, ended the hearing by appearing to rebuke the intelligence officials for their testimony. At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer, he said. The following day will see the much-anticipated testimony of Mr Comey, who was leading one of the Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. He will be quizzed on his interactions with the president before he was sacked. Mr Comey reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president. The conversation occurred the day after the president asked Mr Comey to end the investigation into Mr Flynn during a private dinner, according to the New York Times. Mr Comey believed the attorney general should protect the FBI from White House influence, officials told the paper.",

But he played down differences with the Welsh Government over Brexit. The UK government is under pressure to change its approach to leaving the EU, which critics call a hard Brexit. Mr Cairns's predecessor, Stephen Crabb, claimed the election had changed the terms of the Brexit debate. The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP is backing calls from Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson for Theresa May to adopt a more flexible approach that achieves a consensus across parties. Mr Crabb told BBC Wales The majority of business opinion in Wales and the UK supports Britain staying in the single market and staying in the customs union but still coming out of the European Union legally. And I think that argument needs to get looked at far more closely and if we can't achieve a satisfactory deal based on membership of the single market we need something that is pretty close to it if it's going to achieve the consensus that it needs to across the parties. Wales Office Minister Guto Bebb said the process of listening to devolved governments had begun. It is seven times more important now because of the result of the election that the devolved countries have a real voice in the process of leaving the European Union, he said. Mr Cairns, newly re-appointed to his role, said he wanted Brexit negotiations, due to start next week, to focus on the right outcome with businesses trading freely. We've talked about frictionless trade, the Welsh Government have talked about unfettered access. These are one and the same things, he said. Even the Labour Party don't want to remain part of the single market so it would be completely wrong to stay in the single market when the two largest parties are opposed to that. But Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire MP Simon Hart echoed Mr Crabb's call for cross-party consensus. He said he did not buy the idea that because Theresa May has had an unquestionably difficult time for which she takes some of the blame it means it's game over.",

On Saturday, Qatar's foreign minister rejected the list of 13 conditions imposed by Saudi Arabia and its allies, Egypt, the UAE and Bahrain. They accuse Qatar of backing terrorism - a charge it denies. Qatar has been under unprecedented diplomatic and economic sanctions for more than two weeks, with Iran and Turkey increasingly supplying it with food and other goods. The four countries also want Qatar to reduce its ties with Iran and close a Turkish military base, setting a deadline on Friday of 10 days. Among other things, the fellow Gulf states have demanded the closure of Al Jazeera TV, which is funded by the Qatari government. Mr Tillerson said Qatar was assessing the demands and stressed there were significant areas which provide a basis for ongoing dialogue leading to resolution. He urged the countries to sit together to stop terrorism and counter extremism. A lowering of rhetoric would also help ease the tension, Mr Tillerson said. After the demands were made on Friday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the dispute was a family issue that the countries should work out together. On Saturday, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, quoted by Al Jazeera, said The US secretary of state recently called upon the blockading nations to produce a list of grievances that was 'reasonable and actionable'. The British foreign secretary asked that the demands be 'measured and realistic.' This list does not satisfy that sic criteria. He said the demands were proof that the sanctions had nothing to do with combating terrorism... but limiting Qatar's sovereignty, and outsourcing our foreign policy. Al Jazeera accused them of trying to silence freedom of expression, adding We assert our right to practise our journalism professionally without bowing to pressure from any government or authority. Qatar's main import routes - by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from container ships docked in the UAE - have been disrupted, and much of the surrounding airspace has been closed to its air traffic. However, the small but wealthy country has so far avoided economic collapse by finding alternative routes. Qatari citizens living in neighbouring countries or with family living there have been hit harder, Reuters news agency notes, because of ultimatums issued for them to leave. The United Arab Emirates has been trying to mediate in the crisis. UAE's foreign minister said on Saturday there would be a parting of ways with Qatar if it failed to meet the demands. The alternative is not escalation, he said. The alternative is parting of ways. It's very difficult for us to maintain a collective grouping with one of the partners... actively promoting what is an extremist and terrorist agenda. US President Donald Trump has taken a hard line towards Qatar, accusing it of being a high-level sponsor of terrorism. However, the Arab states involved in the crisis are all close allies of the US, while the largest US base in the Middle East is in Qatar.",

    "input": "Media playback is not supported on this device Of his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine. Winning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable. And yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price. Murray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern. Opting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer? Although it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell. Media playback is not supported on this device Murray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets. As well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome no disgrace, to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells. Though he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open. So, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon. Murray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final. It would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years. Yet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field. He has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way. This year he has won 72 of points on first serve, down from 76 last year and while last year he saved 66 of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54. He claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden. But perhaps Murray has lost his cause he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter. That may not be a concern much longer. Murray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest. In fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further. Nadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further. And then there's Roger Federer the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.

Laura, who was abused by the gang from the age of 13 until she was 17, said the targeting of girls by Asian men was still going on in Greater Manchester. Greater Manchester Police GMP said it was committed to tackling abusers. Laura, whose identity is protected as a victim of a sex crime, told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire show said she was walking in Oldham town centre through an Asian community a couple of months ago. I was still getting cars pulling over to me asking me if I wanted to go for a drink, said Laura. It's not bothering them. I don't actually think they understand that they are doing something wrong. Nazir Afzal the north west's former chief crown prosecutor who brought the case against the Rochdale gang said five years on some victims nationally are still not being listened to. Mr Afzal overturned a decision not to charge nine men who ran the child sex exploitation ring. He said there have been significant rises in investigations and prosecutions into the crime and victims were more confident in reporting abuse and they are getting better support. However, he said Victim support groups nationally are still telling me victims are not being consistently listened to and told the case is too difficult to bring to court. He also said some victims of historical child sex exploitation were being told that police were focusing on current cases, too. Mr Afzal said agencies must be more proactive and more collaborative working was needed between the police, councils and other agencies and voluntary groups. GMP said it was vital they learnt the lessons from the past and it was absolutely committed to working with partners across Greater Manchester to tackle the sexual exploitation of children and young people. We have been working tirelessly for many years to prevent this abhorrent crime from happening and provide support to victims and their families. Rochdale Council said public services collectively failed the victims but lessons have been learnt from it. Steve Rumbelow, chief executive of Rochdale Borough Council, said Since 2012 the council and its partners have worked to make the changes needed, to increase knowledge, prevent harm, challenge those who wish to exploit children and better support victims and survivors.

Southend boss Phil Brown expects Ranger to return to training before their first League One game on 5 August. When the season starts, we'll try to get games behind closed doors so he can get a level of match fitness, Brown told BBC Essex. After Ranger pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud by obtaining bank details and transferring money, Southend said they would consider the player's future. Speaking after their pre-season friendly defeat by Brighton on Tuesday, Brown said Nile has to understand that these players are playing with discipline and have done for the last three or four weeks. The best we will get out of Nile is probably a week's work and that won't be enough for him to be fit for the start of the season. Ranger joined Southend in August 2016 and scored eight goals in 27 league appearances last season.",

With four minutes of extra time left, Jordan Clark restored the lead but Hugill levelled again in added time. But Billy Kee struck in the third minute of stoppage time to give Stanley victory over their Lancashire rivals. Kee also scored in Accrington's 3-1 win against Colchester on the opening day of League Two. They have now knocked out higher league opposition in the EFL Cup for the second successive year after they beat Burnley last season. Accrington Stanley boss John Coleman told BBC Radio Lancashire I'm delighted with the result as it was a difficult game. It was a full-blooded derby and just to be competing against teams like this on what we believe is a level playing field is testament to how far the club's come. Preston are a good side and they showed that. They moved the ball really well and we knew that from when we played them in a pre-season friendly. We were a different animal tonight. We created far more problems for them. Preston North End manager Alex Neil told BBC Radio Lancashire To be honest we shouldn't have been forcing for extra-time. At 1-1 we looked like we were going to go on and win the game. When we conceded the corner I thought I've seen this a million times before. We conceded from a set piece which is really frustrating. If you look at the game, we had numerous opportunities and chances, we didn't take them or make them count and ultimately we got punished because of that.

My exams aren't until May so Commonwealths being in April, it's just not going to work out unfortunately, said the middle distance runner. I go back to university next week. I've got a week off then back to my studies to complete my final year. Media playback is not supported on this device I love running for Scotland whenever I can and the Commonwealths are one of the few opportunities you can do it so, yeah, I'm gutted I'm going to be missing it. But you have to think about getting my degree and that was really important to me. I'm sure the team's going to do so, so well. They're going to do great. I think I've got at least two, even three more Olympics in me. What events? I don't know. Certainly, so much scope for the future. However, Muir says the World Indoor Championships in March are potentially a target. These next few months are going to be very full on with my studies, she explained. I feel like I'm in reasonable shape. I'd like to run in Birmingham. Hellen Obiri upset defending world champion Almaz Ayana to win 5,000m gold in London, with Sifan Hassan third. Muir's time of 14 minutes 52.07 seconds was her new outdoor personal best. I'm really happy, she said after Sunday's race. It was really tough competition out there. I'm delighted with that.
