    "input": "Oneminute speeches Rule 144 The next item is the oneminute speeches on matters of political importance PL Mr President for a number of months now Polish farmers and exporters of farm produce have been unable to export their products to the Russian Federation In March this year Ukraine became the latest country to ban the import of meat and meat products from Poland The decision was taken without giving any legal grounds for it It is surprising that talks between the European Union and the Russian Federation have yielded no results Perhaps the European Commission does not attach the required importance to matters of trade between Poland and Russia and gives priority to other interests of the European Union and other countries For this reason I again ask the European Commission to do everything it can to have the export ban on Polish agricultural products in Ukraine and Russia lifted This is a problem that is within the competence of the European Commission and also within the scope of its responsibility IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen a few hours ago an Internet website linked to Al Qaeda declared a holy war through the Internet inviting all the Muslim hackers of the world to bombard Christian websites especially the Popes This is in my opinion an extremely serious matter and an attack on the fundamental principle of religious freedom P When the freedom to be able to address the world by means of communication is under attack especially at the highest level and aim is taken at a religion indeed at an entire system of belief one of the basic values of the European Union is under attack the principle of religious freedom Europe cannot remain silent about this We are faced with an escalation of actions and initiatives whose purpose is to strike at the basic principles of our freedom We must defend ourselves from such arrogance and from such a totalitarian escalation of Islamic fundamentalist extremism HU I feel that as a Hungarian MEP I ought to respond to the sudden international interest in my homeland P It is my conviction that there is unnecessarily great concern in the European Parliament with internal political struggles and my Hungarian colleagues in the opposition have brought an atmosphere of Cold War politics into the building We did not receive our mandate in order to bring the conflicts among our domestic parties onto a European political stage as this serves only to increase the distance between the European institutions and the citizens of the European Union It cannot be in anyones interest to present a biased image of Hungary and to destroy the positive image of the country that we have worked so hard to build up P If we want the decreasing confidence in the EU and its institutions to be restored we must transcend petty conflicts of interest and engage in Europeanstyle politics to meet the not insignificant challenges that face us The further enlargement of the Union offences against human rights the negative effects of globalisation and the efficient collection and expenditure of EU funds for the development of neglected regions are but a few of these We have a lot to do IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen less than twentyfour hours ago I was in Moscow and for one moment was on the point of putting on the MEPs sash while I was among the thousands of people paying their last respects to Anna Politkovskaya Then I thought that that would offend the gaze of that lady even though she could not see me to see our emblem on display P The journalist Anna Politkovskaya told us what you did not wish to see or hear On page 6 of todays Le Monde we read about people arrested in Moscow because they said Georgians we are on your side Georgians not Chechens The symbols worn by those who were arrested were moreover those of the Transnational Radical Party We as radicals and liberals have brought to this Parliament members of the Chechen Government in exile who came to announce that they had chosen nonviolence Nothing was done about it P Mr President allow me to make a suggestion let us no longer call our buildings Schuman or Adenauer let us call them Daladier and Ollenhauer Let us remove these names that we have no right to use P The President cut off the speaker NL Mr President I should like to draw your attention to the poisoning scandal involving the Probo Koala in Ivory Coast a few weeks ago the repercussions of which are as yet incalculable The ship has or will soon have permission to leave Estonia There is still much uncertainty as to what will happen with the poison and the contaminated crew My observer who travelled to Estonia on my behalf totally agrees with Commissioner Dimas when he says that this is only the tip of the iceberg Poison of that kind should never have left the EU in the first place This is a breach of European and international law Having been denied the opportunity to speak with the crew of the Probo Koala on several occasions despite prior permission I can only conclude that various authorities are playing a very underhand game with human lives a game that is not yet over by a long way The Probo Emoe is already appearing over the horizon HU As I mentioned at the meeting last week of the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs the greatest and most tangible achievement of the rule of law is precisely citizens free exercise of political rights These of course are not to be confused with inadmissible violent acts P For this reason I wish to draw Parliaments attention to the investigations and the offences requiring investigation which took place in Budapest on the night of 1920 September the consequences of which are still being felt to this day calling into question the effectiveness of the rule of law in Hungary According to complaints the police used excessive force on the two days in question and took disproportionately harsh measures not only against the demonstrators but against young people including several foreign nationals who were on the streets Among those they arrested punished collectively and in some cases still continue to detain were some individuals who had absolutely nothing to do with the violent events P It is important that the use of force to curtail fundamental human rights and in particular personal freedom such as preliminary arrest and detention should be used only in cases where they are absolutely convinced that this is truly necessary HU Mr President the European spirit is under threat in Hungary we are moving further away from Europe The socialist Minister of Local Government and Regional Development made a promise to his fellow coalition members last Saturday that he would make the appropriate legislative amendments to ensure that in future development funds from the European Union are distributed based on party political considerations P If this becomes a reality it would no longer be elected bodies that decide on the use of funds from the EU budget but rather party political intentions would set the course thus providing fertile ground for nontransparent unverifiable spending This declaration not only endangers Hungarys credibility in the European Union but also the development of a European spirit in Hungary which demands that EU funds should serve cohesion and unity among the Hungarian people based on the realisation of the fundamental principles of democracy P The remarks by the socialist minister unambiguously point to the fact that the use of EU funds serves the aim of enriching the Hungarian socialist party elite Mr President last Friday the Hungarian Government gained a solid majority in a vote of confidence in the Hungarian Parliament As a result our national currency has become stronger economic prospects are better and Hungary has returned to normal life There is no general crisis in Budapest Only our leading opposition party Fidesz is in crisis The elected members of the national parliament lead antidemocratic demonstrations on the streets instead of opposing the government inside the parliament As far as I know elected parliamentarians should work in the parliament not on the street where extremeright wrongdoers who were also demonstrating set fire to a building housing a television station P It would be very wise if the PPEDE Group could tell its Hungarian members that parliamentary democracy should mean respect for parliament respect for parliamentary elections and strict borderlines between democratic politics and nonparliamentary extremism Mr President a report recently issued by the United Nations Human Rights Office for Iraq states that the bodies at the Baghdad mortuary often bear signs of horrific torture including acid burns excision of eyes and teeth and wounds made by drills and nails Human rights organisations have repeatedly reported that acts of torture are taking place in the prisons run by the US and British forces and the Iraqi Ministry of Justice and Defence and in prisons controlled by various military factions The UN Human Rights Offices position is that the level of torture in Iraq today is worse than it was during Saddam Husseins rule of terror P The EU and Parliament in particular have an obligation to respond appropriately to this UN report I call upon you as well as the President of the Commission and the Finnish Presidency to make a clear statement on the issue as soon as possible PL Mr President at last years confidential session of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on a new partnership agreement with Russia the PCA Mr Brok the chairman of the committee acted in a scandalous way Mr Brok reacted brusquely to my question to Mr Mingarelli whose job was to reassure the new Member States that the planned agreement with Russia would not affect their energy security and that the agreement would not be concluded in the manner of the agreement on building the northern pipeline in other words that it would not protect exclusively German interests In a raised voice he replied that it was the kind of question that might be raised at an election rally in his country and rejected it without giving the speaker a chance to reply Leaving aside the fact that the reaction itself was quite arrogant and supercilious Mr Brok allowed the principles of parliamentary democracy which is based on pluralism of views and freedom of expression by MEPs to be violated His behaviour showed extreme bias in the running of the committee towards securing the sanctity of GermanRussian relations P I ask the President to respond to this and to explain the behaviour of Mr Brok in his discrimination against MEPs from the new Member States FR Mr President one event chases away another Nonetheless we are now witnessing live the escalation of violations of the rules of international law perpetrated by Russia against Georgia the granting of Russian citizenship to the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia the rejection of the peace plan proposed by Georgia to settle the conflicts with the separatist regions and the closure of the two border crossing points Tension has further increased following the arrest of Russian spies by Georgia with reprisals from Moscow which has hunted down Georgians and is trying to economically strangle its neighbour by unilaterally introducing sanctions blocking trade between Russia and Georgia Finally by giving the impression that Russia would recognise the separatist regions South Ossetia and Abkhazia if Kosovo gained its independence Mr Putin makes the resolution of the conflict even more remote The list is long and the Georgians are utterly exasperated P Faced with this situation on the brink of explosion the European Union has a crucial role to play in bringing the sides and especially Russia on the occasion of European UnionRussia negotiations to the negotiating table to find a solution and put an end to this latent conflict in the Southern Caucasus The Neighbourhood Policy allows us this military action would be a total failure of our policies IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen EUR 10 billion is the sum that the Italian Government has concealed and written off from its debts in presenting the national budget for 2007 I thank you warmly for having given me the floor to make it known through this Parliament especially to the Commission that the budget that has reached you from the Italian Government lacks a debit entry of EUR 10 billion P To whom is this debit owed To the Italian pensioners who have worked in Switzerland and are awaiting this payment of EUR 10 billion which the Italian Government has no intention of paying and what is worse which they have deleted from the budget No one knows that there is a debit item of EUR 10 billion in the Italian national budget I hope that from today it will be known to everyone ET Mr President last Saturday Russia was once again the scene of a political murder The first few years of the 21st century have clearly demonstrated that in Russia the right to express the truth is a taboo for which people must all too often pay the ultimate price their lives P Political foul play has become a part of everyday life in Russia and unfortunately we too must come to terms with this Anna Politkovskayas struggle for democracy human rights and freedom of expression is the best thing that could have been done in the interests of tomorrows Russia and a better Europe P Ladies and gentlemen I sincerely believe and hope that Parliament and the unofficial meeting of the Heads of State or Government at the informal dinner to be held in Lahti on 20 October will be able to exert sufficient pressure on President Putin to ensure that the truth of this terrible injustice is revealed as soon as possible and that all those who participated in it are brought to justice PL Mr President I would like to raise the issue of water shortages which is becoming an important matter for many citizens of Europe P Water is necessary for life and for economic activity Unfortunately the constant increase in temperatures in the 25 Member States by 02oC over 10 years and a reduction in precipitation in many regions have made access to water increasingly difficult for many citizens leading to losses in agriculture and problems in manufacturing The water situation is rapidly deteriorating while investments in renewing water resources and water conservation are a longterm costly process This makes it necessary to organise training and the exchange of experience and to popularise best practice and methods for the rational use of water and water conservation Economic activities should also be redirected towards rationalising the water situation in all areas of the economy Water shortages could become a barrier to agricultural production and in particular to the production of raw materials for biofuels whose supply is not a problem The water situation must be constantly monitored and Parliament needs to be kept regularly informed P The President cut off the speaker LT While travelling to the Womens Basketball World Championships the Lithuanian basketball players ended up stuck in French Guiana on their way to Brazil and were unable to depart for four days Brazil refused to admit anyone who was not vaccinated against yellow fever P After subsequent vaccination and the verbal assurances of the Minister of Health of Brazil that everything would be all right the Lithuanian team finally reached Belen in Brazil by chartered aeroplane However they were rudely forced back onto the plane by immigration officers and sent back to Cayenne P Only the Lithuanian basketball players received such treatment Other Europeans who were vaccinated at the same time were admitted to Belen Brazilian officers made it clear that German players would face no problems in this situation P Why is Lithuania subject to double standards as if it were not a European Union Member State It would appear necessary to allocate more funding for raising awareness about the new EU countries not only within the EU but also abroad LT Can a mouse really scare an elephant It would appear so and the current crisis in relations between Russia and Georgia is evidence of this P The European Union has a choice of how to react to events in its neighbourhood it can just make a statement or get actively involved in the peaceful settlement of this conflict P I welcome the participation of Mr De Gucht the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs in handing over the Russian officers to Russia and his statement made on behalf of the EU However this is still not enough P I believe that if Russia is considering the possibility of military action in resolving the conflict with Georgia the European Union must make every effort to immediately stop the deportation of Georgians from Russia and the compiling of lists of pupils from Moscow schools with Georgian family names as this reminds us of the policy of Nazi Germany and the deportation of citizens of Jewish nationality P During the deportations following the Soviet occupation my parents were transported to Siberia in wagons for animals Now the means of transport have changed Georgians are deported from Moscow in planes used for the transport of cargo Such acts and such a policy cannot be allowed to continue PL Mr President in May this year we adopted at second reading the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods which states that as of 1 January 2007 European law will make food producers responsible for placing accurate information regarding the properties of food products on packaging This means in practice that all the health benefits of products must be confirmed by independent laboratories P Unfortunately these regulations will only superficially benefit consumers Also the EU regulation may eliminate the products of small and mediumsized companies who will be unable to afford tests of the same standard as wealthy European firms In effect consumers will have less and less choice and will be unable to make informed purchases and they will still not know what they are actually buying The destructive mechanism of such competition could be restricted by licensing the right to issue recommendatory health symbols and creating a uniform system of recognising healthy products It is also essential to give special support to small and mediumsized enterprises whose products are often of higher quality than the products of large companies on our common market PL Mr President the Republic of Lithuania gained independence just over a decade ago This fact was celebrated by all of democratic Europe Lithuania immediately started to introduce social and economic reforms the aim of which was to eliminate the remains of Soviet occupation An important role in achieving independence was played by the large Polish minority 10 of the total population which has for centuries inhabited the areas around the capital Vilnius However although many years have gone by since the end of Soviet rule the Lithuanian authorities have so far failed to return to the Poles the land that was confiscated from them by the occupying forces And despite numerous agreements Lithuania has refused to allow Polish names to be written in their Polish spelling insisting that they be written in Lithuanian These activities are a blatant breach of European regulations on national and ethnic minorities in EU Member States CS Mr President ladies and gentlemen I should like if I may to draw the Chambers attention to a serious problem facing the Czech Republic as regards drawing on cohesion funds for modernising the wastewater sector In order for us to honour our obligations under the directive on wastewater treatment we will have to invest over EUR 4 million by 2010 more than 10 of our annual national budget We agree of course that this cannot be done without EU subsidies I therefore fail to understand how it is possible that in the Commission there are projects aimed at bringing clean water to Czech towns that have been lying untouched for a year and a half These are projects put forward by our water companies based on an operational model that is in line with Community law and yet Commission officials acting on the basis of personal whim refuse to authorise them and try instead to dictate to us the elected representatives of these towns what sort of contracts we should be signing and how we should be solving the problems of the water sector Let us not forget that the Czech Republic is in the heart of Europe and that the main European rivers rise there and flow into neighbouring countries This is therefore not only a Czech problem but also a European one IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I have emphasised the untimeliness of the statement by Mr Barroso President of the Commission before the vote in Parliament on the Eurlings report on Turkey since Mr Barroso influenced the vote with his negative observations aimed at ruling out Turkeys prospects of membership Furthermore given the subsequent comments by Mr Rehn and Mr Verheugen one must think that Mr Barroso was lacking in foresight concerning not only our Parliament but also the Commission itself P I wish to express my full support for Mr Verheugens statement which confirmed the objective of full membership of the European Union for Turkey and emphasised that it is in our interests to have a Turkey that is linked to the West that is a democratic Turkey governed by the rule of law which respects human rights and protects the rights of minorities This in my opinion is the objective that we must keep in view a European Union that is capable of promoting democracy and the rule of law and please allow me to say this Mr President a European Union that should have had the courage to send representatives of Parliament the Commission and the Council to the funeral of Anna Politkovskaya something that in the event it did not do SV Mr President you recently contended that the historic dimension possessed by the EU seat in Strasbourg cannot be viewed in the same way by certain Nordic countries that did not participate in the Second World War The people of the Nordic region did not suffer enough during the Second World War to be able to understand the symbolic value of having the European Parliament in Strasbourg Thus Nordic criticism of the European Parliaments expensive commute to Strasbourg can be dismissed P Your statement was of course entirely erroneous from an historical point of view Finland Norway and Denmark were in fact involved in the Second World War but it is also remarkable in another respect in that the President of the European Parliament is entirely serious in believing that we should not listen to views on the sites at which the European Parliament sits if such views are expressed by citizens and MEPs from countries that did not take part in the Second World War This is a grotesque idea the only redeeming feature of which is that we thus need not listen to the President either as Spain was also a noncombatant country in the Second World War This line of thought is unreasonable The peoples of Ireland Portugal Spain and Sweden today have as much right to be heard in the current debate as those of other countries It is scandalous that the person entrusted to be the President of the European Parliament should have such poor judgment as to consider himself entitled to tell us whom we should listen to and whom we should try to silence P The President cut off the speaker Thank you very much Mr Lundgren I wonder whether you have had time to read the letter that I wrote in response to the letter sent to me by several Members and which you will have received Have you read it If you have I do not understand your question You are still saying things that are entirely false P In that letter I explained to everybody what I said What I said is nothing like what you claim I have said In that letter I explain clearly that I merely pointed out that some countries may be influenced in their points of view by the fact that during their history they did not take part in the world war That is in no way intended to imply that some countries have no right to express an opinion It does not mean that their opinion should not be heard I simply say that they have different opinions and that one of the reasons for that may be that they have different histories P Why do you say that the President of Parliament is denying anybody the right to express an opinion Do you imagine that I am stupid enough to deny any European citizen the right to express an opinion because of their countrys history P Of course everybody has the right to express their opinion I simply say that opinions may vary for differing historical reasons Quite frankly I do not understand why we are having such an absurd debate about a misinterpretation of my words that you I regret to say are persisting with HU It is unfortunate that the question of the conflict between Georgia and Russia and a debate on these unusually disturbing tensions is not on the agenda This would be a very opportune time for such a discussion P Things are happening in the Caucasus that may seem astonishing at first glance but in reality are the natural consequences of a decade and a half of RussianGeorgian relations The retaliation and punishment following the discovery of a group of Russian spies reflect a warlike situation It is unacceptable that the Russians should expel Georgian citizens from the country on the basis of their ethnic identity We are faced with a violation of human and civil rights and freedoms It is obvious that the Russian Federation cannot accept that it has lost its influence over the Georgian Republic It finds this hard to bear as it feels its identity as a great power threatened P The Council the Commission and Parliament have a great responsibility They need to intervene more decisively and negotiate with the Russians First of all we need to establish what the territorial integrity of Georgia means for at present this is understood in several different ways It is only through peaceful means that a solution can be found and we must avoid the outbreak of another armed conflict in the region Mr President I wish to raise the European perspective of the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair Until recently Aer Lingus was the Irish national carrier and in state ownership It was in a healthy economic situation but needed to raise finance to renew its fleet The Irish Government said that the EU would not permit any state investment in the airline which is news to me As I understand it a state has flexibility in investing in airlines if in fact they are in a healthy economic position as indeed Aer Lingus was This is another example of the blame Brussels mentality whereby a national government can explain its own actions by saying the EU will not allow that when that is not necessarily the case However that is history and we now have Aer Lingus being targeted in a takeover bid by its main rival Ryanair P In a way it is ironic that on the one hand we blame the EU for the current situation when in fact no blame attaches while on the other hand we will undoubtedly make a case to the Commissions DG Competition to block the takeover to save us from our own actions and to protect us from the consequences of those actions PT Mr President I should like to take this opportunity to salute Portuguese workers and their union confederation the CGTIN who will be holding a general day of protest tomorrow 12 October against the rightwing policies pursued in Portugal Among other issues the Portuguese workers are fighting against the governments social security proposals aimed at raising the retirement age and at reducing pensions they are fighting to protect and increase domestic manufacturing to create jobs with associated rights to defend public services and public administration designed to serve the citizens and they are fighting for the right to collective contracts for higher wages and for the fair distribution of wealth P I wish to say a final word Mr President on the European Court of Justices recent ruling on the Cadman case regarding maternitypaternity leave and salary calculations In my view it is utterly unacceptable that this could be seen as and used for the purpose of bringing into question the principle of equal pay for equal work which is enshrined in Article 59 of the Constitution of the Republic of Portugal SK Last June the European Commission developed a proposal envisaging a reduction in land areas taken up by vineyards in the European Union The losses and consequences resulting from this reduction would be offset through a package of direct agricultural payments totalling EUR 24 billion This proposal would affect nearly 12 of the total surface area of vineyards in other words approximately 4 000 hectares tended by about one and a half million viticulturists This step could entirely undermine wine production in Slovakia which has experienced substantial growth over the past few years especially in terms of wine quality in addition this comes at a time when Slovak wines are becoming increasingly competitive in European Union markets P The Commissions proposal also prohibits the use of added sugar in producing certain types of wine although in my country this procedure is traditional as the vines cultivated in Slovakia are characterised by higher acidity which is typical for the region I am not questioning the need for reform in the European wine market but I believe we should look to other solutions Mr President next week a LIBE Committee delegation will visit Algeria However one of the Algerian visa requirements is the absence of an Israeli visa passport stamp Mr Gaubert noticed this and was rightly appalled at this blatant antiSemitism He demanded an explanation The matter was referred to you Mr President and you were asked to make representations to the Algerians I understand that you refused to do so saying it was a matter for individual MEPs Mr Gaubert has quite rightly refused to go on the trip P This raises two important issues First why has the European Union sent almost one billion euro to Algeria since 1996 when that country is implementing a blatantly antiSemitic policy The EU should stop these payments immediately P The second issue is the apparent dereliction of duty by you Mr President when you could have made a stand against Algerias antiSemitism backed by the weight of your office Please reconsider and rectify this situation The truth is that I do not know what you are referring to Mr Batten but you are welcome to clarify what you have said to me If you would be kind enough to give me the details I will be able to ascertain whether or not I have acted correctly and if necessary I will put things right P I am happy for you to explain your point further PL Mr President todays debate about the soft fruit sector gives rise to the hope that the two years of attempts to change the organisation of the fruit and vegetable market are now beginning to take effect Is it not strange that the Member State that supplies 90 of the EUs frozen strawberries had to wait so long for a decision to introduce protective customs tariffs Many Polish farmers have incurred huge losses in the past few years while waiting for an end to Chinese dumping on the market Nobody will compensate them for these losses But the fruit and vegetable market is not confined just to strawberries The 18 main produce types introduced by the new Member States are an issue that has still not been regulated These include above all cooking apples Polish apple growers will soon be protesting against the low prices offered by the processing industry P Parliament has spent two years attempting to regulate this sector of the fruit and vegetable market so far to no avail Suffice it to say that apples are the main fruit in the European Union as regards harvesting they account for 32 of all fruit harvested while the EU is also a major importer of this fruit How much longer will we have to wait for this and other segments of the fruit and vegetable market to be regulated as promised in the European Parliaments resolution on simplification of the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables of 11 May 2005 Will this vote be honoured by the European Commission A member of the secretariat will speak to Mr Batten so that he can explain the point he has made with regard to relations with Algeria and the Presidents compliance with his duties P That concludes this item",

    "input": "The protection and welfare of animals 20062010 debate The next item is the report by Mrs Jeggle on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the protection and welfare of animals in the period 2006 to 2010 Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen on 23 January 2006 the Commission presented its Communication on a Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 20062010 P The report I drew up on this Communication as rapporteur for this House was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 September The objective of the Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals is to bring together Community activities previously spread across different Commission services councils and policy areas and to structure them in accordance with uniform guidelines P Animal protection is an emotional extremely politically sensitive issue Such protection appropriate to the specific needs and requirements of the respective animals should be a matter of course in our civil society On this basis it is important to me as rapporteur that we establish a uniform level of animal protection in the EU The Commission has emphasised time and again that the EUs animalprotection standards which are already high and are set to be improved still further are an example to the world A large majority in the committee supported my emphasis on the need for precise impact assessments in the case of all legislative measures on animal protection In addition it is only consistent to demand these high animalprotection standards in negotiations with the WTO and in bilateral agreements P Genuine animal protection cannot be restricted to farmed animals and animals used in experiments but must cover all animals In addition the progress that has been made must be taken into account Many of my fellow Members and many people who have written to me are particularly concerned about animals used in experiments The scientific research sector has significantly stepped up its efforts to protect animals in recent years however A large number of alternatives to animal testing have been developed in order to translate the 3Rs principle into practice Even though there is still a long way to go on this I do think that we are moving in the right direction The report supports endeavours to replace animal testing with alternative methods on the basis of further research For this reason we are making consistent calls for resources to be made available under the Seventh Research Framework Programme too Precise scientifically based animalprotection indicators are the most reliable basis for the further development of viable animal protection P This baseline report for the 20062010 period is not intended to detail any specific individual measures We do not support any amendments calling for the nonbinding application of voluntary animalprotection standards at national level The report makes an emphatic call for proper application and enforcement of the existing rules on animal protection for example in the field of animal transport We welcome the proposed ban on imports of cat and dog fur and call for decisive action to restrict the trade in seal products The need for accession countries to adapt their legislation as a matter of urgency has been emphasised In addition we strongly support a simple compulsory EU label for animal protection P There are 14 amendments We support Amendments 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 and 14 but cannot support Amendments 1 9 10 or 13 We have requested split voting on paragraphs 5 7a 29 54 and 71 P To the Commissioner I would say that Commissioner Kyprianou is currently in Brazil where I am sure he will praise European animalprotection standards I hope that he will also speak about the deficiencies in agricultural products imported into the EU from Brazil that have been detected once again by the EU Food and Veterinary Office European agriculture and European consumers suffer as a result of distortions of competition The European animal protection standards that are being called for must also have a positive impact on our competitiveness I am much obliged to the Commissioner and I am obliged to all my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation Mr President with regard to the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals I am grateful for all the hard work done by the members of the committees concerned Let me acknowledge in particular the efforts of Mrs Jeggle on this important initiative P Animal welfare is a subject of major concern for EU citizens stakeholders and Members of Parliament They have all been very vocal in calling for higher standards of protection for animals not just in the EU but worldwide The Commission is working hard and with some success to develop a greater international consensus on animal welfare For instance we have been instrumental in the development of animal welfare standards by the World Organisation for Animal Health We should remember that the issue is not restricted to farm animals but also extends to experimental zoo circus and wild animals P The action plan seeks to promote a broadbased approach to animal welfare involving all stakeholders so that everyone plays their part It is not just a matter for farmers or animal handlers scientists industry citizens and governments all have a role to play Moreover it is an area which can render sectors of the EU economy more competitive and the proposed establishment of a European information platform would facilitate an open dialogue and a sharing of expertise and experience P There are also strong links with other Community policies for example the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment the principle of better regulation and paying proper attention to the scientific social and economic principles underpinning Community policies As highlighted in Parliaments report and in the Austrian Presidencys conclusions more research is needed to address current knowledge gaps and strengthen the scientific basis for our policies In particular the development and validation of objective sciencebased animal welfare indicators are key to the successful implementation of the action plan This work could be improved by the establishment of a Community centre for the protection and welfare of animals The Commission needs and intends to consult widely during the coming months including with Member States and stakeholders on the expectations for such a centre P In implementing the action plan the Commission is keen to ensure that policies are developed and implemented in a more coherent and consistent manner respecting our clear obligations under the protocol to the EC Treaty P Animal welfare is an issue of major importance for EU citizens and I very much welcome Parliaments positive attitude towards our initiative The Commission will pay close attention to the aspects highlighted in Parliaments report and I am sure we will return to the action plan many times during the course of its implementation I look forward to Parliaments future support for the initiatives necessary to follow the strategy laid out in the plan draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety SV Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen every day millions of animals suffer be it in the meat industrys animal factories in European slaughterhouses or in the course of transport or painful animal experiments We now have the opportunity to make practical improvements to the conditions experienced by these animals P I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety It was my predecessor Mr Sjöstedt who was responsible for the matter with which we are dealing In the opinion we have drafted we demand for example that animals should have the right to natural behaviour that the overproduction of meat should be prevented that all hens should be entitled to range freely by 2016 at the latest that sows should have the right to roam freely throughout their life cycle and that a maximum time limit of eight hours should be introduced for the transport of animals Therefore it is unfortunately with disappointment that I am forced to note that Mrs Jeggles report does not pay heed to any of these demands P It is thus important for us to influence this report as much as possible The Confederal Group of the European United LeftNordic Green Left has requested a split vote on those points we think make the value of animals dependent on commercial considerations If Mrs Jeggles report is adopted animal protection will only become something worth aiming for if it is not in conflict with the WTO and commercial interests That is how matters actually stand but we cannot have them remain like that Animals have value irrespective of changes in competitiveness P What is important is that we in Europe take the initiative and become competitive through higher standards and better animal protection I would therefore call on you to vote down the wordings in recital G and in paragraphs 51 52 53 and 59 I would also call on you to vote in favour of for example Amendments 11 and 12 now happily also supported by Mrs Jeggle If you vote in this way we can finally obtain an action plan that makes life much better for the hundreds of millions of animals in the EU That is something that animals deserve Mr President Mr President of the Commission Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur Mrs Jeggle for this sound objective professional report It is well known that Austria my home country has a national animal protection act that is among the most modern in Europe I am delighted that this report has borrowed heavily from the Austrian Federal Act on the Protection of Animals which is really very practicable and is concerned with keeping animals in conditions appropriate to the respective species P This whole matter has been very difficult as the European public is rightly concerned about this issue After all the welfare of all animals must be taken into account For this reason I am very disappointed that the previous speaker still refers only to animals for breeding and production not to all animals All animals are living beings and all have a right to be kept in conditions appropriate to their species be it in zoos or homes or as pets Being a farmer who ran a farm for more than 30 years and kept animals there I of all people know how important it is that animals be kept in conditions appropriate to their species The way animals are kept and fed has a particularly strong influence on the quality of the product of the foodstuff they go to produce Accordingly on the basis of my knowledge and daytoday experiences I hold this report in very high regard P I am also delighted that this report mentions animal protection with regard to the WTO and particularly to imports from third countries After all it has to be made quite clear that unless we succeed in making the breeding and keeping of all animals be they from the EU or imported from third countries subject to the same rules there will be no benefit to European farmers European animals or even European consumers as production methods will simply not be as desired P All animals are living beings as I have already said and that is why I should like in retrospect to thank Mrs Jeggle most sincerely once more for her report on behalf of the PSE Group FR Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I would like first of all to thank Mrs Jeggle for her excellent report We are going to vote tomorrow on this report which is the result of long labours and I am delighted at the common position that we have reached I wish however to remind you of three fundamental issues which are actually in the report and that I would like to bring to the fore P Firstly I would like to stress the need to speed up the development validation and approval of alternatives to testing on animals We must give ourselves the financial and logistical means to find other methods that make it possible to avoid these tests We must also limit and strictly regulate these tests in cases where an alternative is not yet possible P Secondly we must not forget that improving animal welfare results mainly in increased production costs for European producers I wish to stress therefore the need to validate their efforts through labelling and through information campaigns to explain the reason for a price difference European producers must not be penalised because they respect the demands of the European Union and improve our food and for their part consumers need to know that the price increases result from an improvement in that food Thanks to the creation of a European label and to the organisation of appropriate marketing and information campaigns consumers will be able to identify those goods produced with particular regard for animal welfare P Thirdly animal welfare must not be a European value only The measures that we are adopting within the European Union must also be respected in all those countries from which we import meat This is vital on both economic and quality grounds The European Commission must do its utmost with the help of international organisations such as the Council of Europe or the World Organisation for Animal Health to make the WTO give more attention to animal welfare and to upward harmonisation of measures relating to it In the long term clearly the aim must be to reach a level of protection for animals that is as high and as uniform as possible on the global scale Mr President Commissioner Mrs Jeggle ladies and gentlemen the Jeggle report contains many aspects necessary and urgent in order to take forward animal protection throughout Europe We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe give priority to all tests aiming to promote informed purchasing decisions by consumers After all in freemarket consumer societies the consumer is king He or she decides whether our chickens lie on straw bedding or are chained to iron bars before they disappear down our throats as Chicken McNuggets whether our pigs are pumped full of medicines to enable them to survive the torments of their short lives or whether stray cats and dogs are skinned to make stylish trimmings for winter coats P Consumers have the power to determine whether to boost and support those farmers in Europe to whom animal protection keeping animals in conditions appropriate to their species and healthy foodstuffs are important or whether to force our farmers to participate in global dumping with rockbottom standards and prices I am convinced that the majority of wellinformed enlightened consumers would never buy a product that had suffered agonising torment before ending up on the shelves Human beings have a tendency to bury their heads in the sand They prefer not to admit the reality of such sad things as animal suffering when they put a joint in the oven P It is our political duty to ensure that consumers are informed about the real conditions of production We politicians must spread our knowledge The power of advice on packaging is demonstrated by the warnings on cigarette packs The Jeggle report calls for a labelling programme to resolve the difficulties consumers have in recognising products that have taken particular account of animal protection I would make an appeal for us to be courageous in this regard The consumer should also be able to tell what has been produced at the cost of appalling animal suffering In this case the consumer would certainly not reach for the cheap goods but opt for a somewhat dearer product that would show his credentials as a animal lover We Europeans are much too defensive in this respect P Let us not be intimidated by cheap competition from third countries we cannot possibly produce as cheaply as they do in any case Let us put our trust in the ever growing community of consumers who make conscious decisions when choosing what to buy and opt for products that guarantee animals are treated with respect Mr President I should like to express my respect to Mrs Jeggle for her work It was not a straightforward job and there are still some inconsistencies to be found but on the whole the line it takes is the right one Mrs Jeggle is not to blame for the inconsistencies I agree with her that our high animalprotection standards must be an example to the world This is particularly applicable since we have not made a particularly good impression as a cultural area in recent years I am thinking here of BSE of dioxins of the culls as a result of footandmouth disease of the millions of animals destroyed and burned on pyres that was not a glorious chapter to show the world For this reason it is important that we adopt a new line in this regard P There is also a sales argument that needs to be taken into account when dealing directly with consumers If there is someone who objects to chickens being kept in cages you can say anything you like but what he wants is a freerange egg he has no appetite for the alternative when he thinks about the chicken There must be market orientation according to considerations of animal protection therefore but we must also realise that animal protection entails costs When we are dealing with anonymous markets which is usually the case with imports from third countries we must have qualified external protection to ensure that our standards are not circumvented because this will be expressed in the price I would say to Mrs Jeggle that the same applies within Europe of course If we do not ensure the implementation of animal protection standards in production distortions of competition will occur within Europe too Consequently we must consider including animal protection in crosscompliance so that there are disincentives for businesses to violate animal protection standards in the form of not only certain penalties but also financial losses for example deductions from premiums on behalf of the GUENGL Group NL Mr President first of all let me say that I warmly welcome the animal welfare action plan What I very much regret though is that this sort of thing should be needed in the first place The way in which people treat animals often reveals their true nature an image that is still not always that agreeable It is still too often the case that animals are treated as commodities with economic gain being more important than their wellbeing I think that this report can at least put an end to a number of diabolical practices to which animals are subjected The report includes something for which I have campaigned for a very long time namely a ban on the practice of castrating piglets without any anaesthetic which is not satisfactory for piglets or farmers The fact that more active support is being demanded for research to replace animal tests by alternative test methods is a great improvement for many animals Needless to say I have many other ideas about animal protection that are more farreaching for example many more freerange cattle the prevention of bull fighting stopping the stuffing of geese with food to enlarge their livers the banning of battery cages and far shorter transport times for animals and I could go on for a while It is unfortunate that a number of sound amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety have been voted out by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development I should like to point out that animal welfare is certainly not just about agricultural animals pets and wild animals should also fall within the scope of the action plan I would call on everyone to let their compassionate hearts speak tomorrow in respect of our fellow creatures and give their full backing to more farreaching amendments in favour of animals We should demonstrate that we in this House do not behave like animals ourselves but vote with their interests in mind Mr President the protection and welfare of animals is a challenge to human culture and civilisation in the 21st century I am very pleased that my amendment expressing this idea was adopted for the draft resolution P Mahatma Gandhi once said that civilisation in a society can be gauged by the way it treats its animals In 21st century Europe there is no place for cruelty to animals It degrades our humanity and there is no place for that It is just a small step from cruelty to animals to cruelty to humans The protection of animals should not be expressed in monetary terms because our civilisation cannot be expressed in monetary terms Animals should be protected from cruelty regardless of cost but under one condition that we apply the conditions of the European Union to all those who export their animal products to the European market on behalf of the INDDEM Group PL Mr President the question of maintaining adequate standards of protection for animals in the EU Member States and the resulting production of suitable food for consumers is of great importance For this reason everything must be done to ensure that only food of a high standard enters the common market Strict measures must be taken to limit the import of products if there is any suspicion that European livestock farming standards have not been applied to them Simply increasing taxes on unfair exporters will not bring any results P I would like to point out that to date it has not been possible for the Community to enforce respect for human rights let alone animal rights A large amount of food is exported into the European market from such countries I would also like to say that small and family farms have traditionally treated their animals humanely and it is large factory farms that diverge from these standards Distortions have also arisen in relation to the issue of guidelines on the slaughter of animals It is a serious mistake to prohibit the slaughter of animals for own consumption on family farms This is a tradition which goes back centuries and the farmers make sure that the animals are slaughtered in appropriate conditions DE Mr President as we know a fair amount has happened since animal protection as a concept was born as a result of increasingly mechanised animal breeding in the 19th century The Action Plan now under discussion is certainly a further important step in the right direction P As we know the EU expressed its concern about dog bull and cock fighting back in 2003 and I am pleased to note that this is also reflected in the present document Strangely however foxhunting has been overlooked Action is also needed in my view in the field of wild birds as the EU still permits hunting of species whose populations have been declining for centuries P In my view it is also particularly important to change our system of farming subsidies at long last so that instead of benefiting mainly large landowners they reward the practice of keeping animals in conditions appropriate to their species one in which the countless smallholders set an example P Finally the abolition of export subsidies for animal transport would not only show more compassion for animals but also protect the environment and help the people who suffer as a result of transit traffic ES Mr President Commissioner I must congratulate the Commission on this proposal and in particular I must congratulate Mrs Jeggle on this wonderful report and the great work that she has done P I simply wished to draw attention to paragraph 71 This paragraph calls for an end to dog bull and cock fighting When it talks about fighting by bulls it is clearly talking about bullfights To treat bullfights in the same way as dogfights and cockfights makes no sense whatsoever Firstly because bulls do not fight each other it is not an animal fighting another animal it is a very noble fight by a man against a bull and sometimes it is the man who dies or is often wounded Furthermore it is a tradition and a culture in our country Maybe some people do not understand this but the bull and bullfighting are very important for us the Spanish I would ask that people have as much respect for the traditions of my country as I have for those of other countries Thank you very much P The bull contributes to the maintenance of pastures it contributes to the protection of the environment and it contributes to rural development Furthermore of the bovine animals it is the bull that has the best life since we are talking about animal welfare it should be pointed out that bulls are very well fed they live in the open air they run around in the way that animals like to do and in the end they die fighting using their own defences The bullfight is much nobler than hunting where at the end of the day the animal dies without being able to defend itself P I would like to thank Mrs Jeggle and the whole of my political group which has understood this and is going to ask that that word be removed from that paragraph ES Mr President animal welfare which has been included in the CAP since the last reform is already an achievement for European agriculture though according to the results of the special Eurobarometer carried out in 2005 on this issue Europeans are unaware of the efforts being made by our producers and do not therefore appreciate them despite the fact that we have the most protective legislation The European Commission has already accepted that consumers need to be better informed on this issue if we want the efforts made by our farmers to be appreciated P This high level of protection has a high economic price however which may reduce the competitiveness of our agrifood industry We need systematic impact studies that analyse the social and economic consequences of any new legislation and reliable scientific analyses that reflect the diversity of situations within the European Union and provide objective indicators of animal welfare and coherence with the Unions other policies and in particular with the Lisbon Strategy and with competitiveness and employment P There are therefore five fundamental aspects improving communication with society rigorous socioeconomic analysis solid scientific foundations greater coherence with other common policies and the promotion of European standards in international fora P With regard to paragraph 71 I would like to say that my group is of course going to vote against that paragraph amongst other things and in particular because it contains a series of technical errors and involves a debate that is completely out of place here a debate that is tarnishing the most important aspects of this report and above all I must say the excellent work of the rapporteur Mrs Jeggle who has been efficient and conscientious and has adopted a very balanced approach Mr President I welcome the action plan and wish to thank Mrs Jeggle for her work P The awareness that many animals in the European Union are treated badly and that more has to be done is of great importance not only out of charity but also because as a developing marketbased approach the humane treatment of animals is an opportunity for European producers if properly developed Animal protection through law is regarded positively by a growing number of Europeans and the labelling of food products from humanelytreated animals could eventually bring economic profits to producers and become a part of the European social model On the other hand global competition tends to push producers for profit at the lowest possible animal protection level P That is why the action plan is also a strong political message to the world By defining our intentions for establishing minimum mandatory standards against the worst abuses we underpin the need for discussion at a global level at the level of the WTO By setting priorities for better treatment of farm animals by avoiding unnecessary suffering caused by tests that could be replaced and by banning the import of cruelty products improving the treatment of animals during transport etc we are pushing for global solutions P We would like to do more as the amendments show but the plan is nevertheless a solid beginning of a comprehensive EU policy in this area ES Mr President cruelty is not culture causing suffering cannot be seen as entertainment Mass industrial suffering is not a legitimate business The demand for justice in our relations with animals calls into question our prevailing human morality and extends its scope If we are to be successful in terms of animal welfare we must reassess our traditional approach to moral responsibility and grant protection and rights also to individual nonhuman animals which have sensory emotional and intellectual capacities P If we are to recognise and extend the rights of animals we must stop causing them unnecessary suffering and refrain from cruelty That is the purpose of this report P We Greens will support the proposal with a series of amendments and we will demand that the Council cease ignoring the majority of Europeans who are in favour of stricter animal protection measures It cannot continue to ignore them P We believe that we must act in an ethical and altruistic manner but that we must also respond to peoples needs and interests We are in favour of improving animal welfare because only in that way can we improve human health the environment and social justice Mr President so vast is the range of the initiatives proposed in this document that it should keep the EU bureaucrats happily beavering away for the next 20 years P However let us examine one of the high points of the EUs record on animal welfare In 2001 during the infamous footandmouth outbreak seven million animals were destroyed in Britain under the EUs direction most of them were healthy I well remember the huge funeral pyres of burning animals The EU stubbornly refused to allow vaccination which would have been in the best interests of the welfare of both the animals and British agriculture It preferred instead the legally questionable and morally unjustifiable scorchedearth approach Therefore I do not believe that the EU is in any position to claim the moral high ground on animal welfare and to lecture the Member States about it never mind the rest of the world as this lofty document claims it will P We have everything in this report including the settingup of an animal protection information forum Doubtless this will be another highly expensive quango Who is going to pay for it The taxpayers Who is going to have to do all the paperwork The farmers who can barely cope with the current red tape P This document is obsessed with standardisation and uniformity It appears to take no account of the widely differing farming cultures and climates to be found in countries as diverse as Portugal and Sweden It takes no account of the already high standards of animal welfare in Britain It is predicated around the central thesis that the EU can do it better but that is not so NL Mr President before I give my reaction I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for her excellent report and the good balance she has struck between what is and is not possible and what we want for animal welfare in Europe I should also like to respond to Mr Titfords remark to the effect that European bureaucracy is responsible for the slaughter of 7 million animals in Great Britain during the footandmouth crisis I should like to put him right on that score When Great Britain joined the European Union Europe was forced to change its legislation We were no longer allowed to vaccinate as a preventive measure We were no longer allowed to vaccinate for footandmouth disease We owe this to the British Government at the time so please do not try to tell me that Europe is to blame for the slaughter of 7 million cows in Great Britain for it has everything to do with the British position at the time I just wanted to get that off my chest I am also saying this because Mrs Jeggles report states quite clearly that vaccination should be a valid instrument for improved animal welfare in the European Union In view of the outbreaks of infectious animal diseases it is good we are making some headway and are in any event using scientific techniques in order to fight them That is the best form of animal welfare in Europe P A second point I wanted to raise concerns animal transport We in this House have asked for a reduction in the duration of transport that involves animals intended for slaughter Unfortunately the Council has not taken this on board but the position of Parliament is clear In that sense I should like to urge Mr Titford if he really wishes to protect animal welfare in his own country too to vote in favour of the Jeggle report That is essential for then you will really do the citizens of Great Britain and those of Europe a good turn P The third reason why I welcome this report is that it draws particular attention to the import of products from outside of the European Union After all we may have fine rules and regulations but if we cannot carry out any monitoring on Europes external borders then they will remain immaterial it is essential that this House should use the Jeggle report to put this back on the agenda PL Mr President if animals could speak I am sure they would thank the rapporteur Mrs Jeggle for standing up for them In her they have an ardent spokesperson and guardian The report deserves considerable recognition It addresses all the most important issues including protection of both animals on farms and those living in the wild The rapporteur has also addressed transportation production economics international aspects product labelling the use of animals for research humanitarian slaughter and so on I believe that with all our help the aims stated in the report of which there are many are achievable We should however pay particular attention to making society more sensitive to the issue to continued involvement of international organisations and spreading awareness which will allow us to achieve the same results as with seal hunting There is nothing that needs to be added to the report I offer the rapporteur my warmest congratulations and so do all the animals SV Mr President a civilised society can never compete on the basis of lowest prices with animals reared under conditions resembling torture Only by means of stringent demands in terms of animal protection will animal husbandry in the EU survive The future lies in local production and short distances for animal transport as well as in consumer protection with animals reared in natural conditions We have an agricultural policy that causes suffering to broilers forces animals to be transported over long distances causes pigs to be castrated and provides more medicines to animals than to people It is not pigs but an agricultural policy like this that should be castrated P A maximum time limit of eight hours for the transport of animals is a reasonable demand Minimum standards of animal protection as per Amendment 11 are necessary We have become as many as four times richer over the last 40 years If we cannot afford to sacrifice a percentage of this wealth in order to protect defenceless animals we cannot call ourselves civilised P To my Spanish friends I would say the following a noble fight would be an unarmed matador against an unarmed bull that is untreated does not have its back broken is not drugged and is not tortured That is what would constitute a noble fight The way such fights look at present however they are about cruelty to animals something that must not be subsidised Thank you Mr President thank you Commissioner and thank you Mrs Jeggle for a very good report because it is essential that we look after animals in Europe P Actually we have a very good record here because we have high production standards but we need to be very much consumerdriven I agree with one of the previous speakers who said that the consumer must have the choice and must be able to see the labels and be absolutely sure of that production If you go into a supermarket and look at a freerange chicken or an organic chicken or an intensivelyfarmed broiler chicken you can actually see no difference between them You have to be absolutely confident that the label is right Not only does it have to be right for the production that we have here in Europe but it also has to be right for the production that comes in from outside Europe as well So consumers have to be very confident of the labelling P We also have to see a reduction in animals used for testing and that is where we have to be very careful with European legislation as well because if we are not careful REACH may actually increase the number of animals tested unnecessarily P Can I refer to Mr Titford and put him right on one or two things First of all he sees European bureaucrats under every bed I think but as far as footandmouth is concerned it was the UK Government that was absolutely determined to slaughter It was the UK Government that was so worried that a general election was being delayed that they had what was called the contiguous cull which slaughtered millions of animals unnecessarily In the Netherlands they actually carried out vaccinations to try and stop the mass funeral pyres So Mr Titford it was not the European Union that had a problem with footandmouth disease it was the UK Government EL Mr President I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report Mrs Jeggle is a sensitive capable and excellent Member of the European Parliament P The great Indian leader Ghandi said that when man treats animals well he demonstrates his humanity and his higher feelings As such I agree with the rapporteur Mrs Jeggle without any doubts However I would like to highlight a delicate and important point which has to do with livestock farming which has to do with man I do not refer to domestic animals to cockfights or to dogfights on which I agree with the rapporteur I refer to reared animals If the measures in the report which I repeat I endorse and support are applied then our livestock farmers will have higher production costs meaning that either we shall have to support them financially or we shall have to find ways of controlling the living conditions of animals reared in third countries whose meat is imported into the European Union Otherwise we shall achieve nothing European livestock farming will shrink due to unfair competition and we shall demonstrate that we are hypocrites rather than animal lovers and that we have no sense of proper solidarity with livestock farmers P Apart from that I should like to highlight another issue I should like stricter controls on wild animal hunting Many of our mountains and forests no longer have any wild animals because there is uncontrolled predatory murder of the animals and this does not only have to do with the animals It disrupts the entire ecosystem in the mountains and forests of Europe and the rest of the world ES Mr President I would like to thank the rapporteur Mrs Jeggle for her work This initiative responds to a social concern one that I believe it is crucial for us to confront not just in the European Union but throughout the world P Animal welfare is important and it is important that we have a single European standard and that it be respected by all of the countries of the European Union We have been worldwide pioneers in relation to these standards and they must be respected because there are few States in the world that can say that they conform to standards like those we apply in the European Union P We have recently talked for example about the rearing of chicken for meat and the transport of animals and in this report by Mrs Jeggle we are not just talking about production farms but also for example about exhibiting animals about zoos about circuses and about research and development areas in which animals are also used We must also talk about domestic animals that we keep as pets in our homes and that also require our attention We must not of course be tolerant with people who abandon them allow them to die of hunger or abuse them P We must apply serious and scientific criteria that ensure that the animals that we keep as pets in our daily lives in the European Union are happy To this end I would like to point out that we have held hearings in this Parliament in which we have heard international experts such as Dr Gonsálvez from Spain who have told us that we must prevent epizootic diseases and invest in their prevention that we must invest in complying with standards governing densities of animals in farms and that we must educate children to respect animals P We must also of course prevent cases such as paragraph 71 introduced as a result of the ignorance and lack of knowledge of certain members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament who have mixed up two entirely different issues by failing to respect the art the traditions and the culture of other people who do not think in the same way as them and who are exemplary in terms of freedom and respect for diversity P We will therefore vote against that paragraph 71 though we fully respect the views of those who do not think in the same way as us DE Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen everything that humans do to animals comes back to them Pythagoras realised this as much as twoandahalfthousand years ago P Looking at the interaction between animal protection animal health sustainability and environmental and food safety I can see that this is still true today Thankfully animal protection now plays a major part in our society The publics desire for ethically and socially sound products is increasing and recently we have been increasingly dealing with sensitive issues such as animal protection relating to breeding transport and slaughter P I welcome the Action Plan for the Protection and Welfare of Animals and I congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her report in which she specifies unequivocally what is needed We need measures to keep the public better informed about modern animalprotection methods and applied animal protection We must improve marketing and also labelling and communication strategies to inform consumers and thus assist them in their purchasing decisions P A simple precise EU label for animal protection could help us harmonise the currently diverging systems of animalprotection labelling and lay down minimum standards for animal protection applicable throughout the EU and I hope beyond our borders too in the near future We must not forget to involve animal breeders and keepers and also public opinion in this animalprotection policy however P Why is it that Community animalprotection policy has been restricted to farmed animals up to now Are cats and dogs not worth protecting just because we do not eat them This appears to be a legitimate question as does the one as to whether pets are always kept in conditions appropriate to their species We hear of all sorts of things taking place for example birds being kept in cages and snakes and other reptiles in urban flats That is why this view has a rightful place in the report P We have been advocating a reduction in the use of animals in research science and product approval Animal testing should be carried out only in the absence of any alternatives Mr President thank you for what has been overall a very interesting and supportive debate I shall inform my colleague Mr Kyprianou of your comments P I should like to touch upon just a couple of your comments Mr Holm emphasised trade issues and suggested that competition is incompatible with animal welfare I disagree It will be very difficult for EU producers to compete in the global market on the basis of price alone This is clear if you look at the competitive advantage of certain third countries in terms of lower land labour or infrastructure costs Instead I think high animal welfare standards should be promoted as one of our competitive advantages We should also remember that as Mr Tarabella said there needs to be real choice for consumers P Recent surveys and research projects have demonstrated consumers active interest in the welfare of farm animals It is clear that consumers believe that they can improve animal welfare through their purchasing power and that a large proportion would be prepared to pay a premium price for such products Ms Resetarits also emphasised this point P The Commission thinks that labelling will eventually make these products more competitive to the benefit of the industry and in particular to those who produce in a welfarefriendly manner We believe that Europes high animal welfare standards need to be seen as a marketing opportunity and a competitive advantage rather than as a burden or liability The policy of using vaccination to prevent the spread of animal diseases has been carefully considered by the Commission and is now integrated into the specific Community legislation on footandmouth disease prevention The same principles are today in the avian influenza measures just adopted P I have to remind Mrs Ayuso González that the Treaty does not allow the Community to act in respect of the use of animals in cultural and traditional events such as bullfighting Therefore the action plan does not foresee any measures in this regard The debate is closed P The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 am P Written statements Rule 142 I welcome this debate The EU has slowly but surely improved the welfare of animals through a number of measures relating to the housing and transportation of animals We now have to build on this and develop quantifiable animal welfare indicators and create a formal framework for animal welfare impact assessments for future EU policies We should also look at the introduction of an EU labelling scheme to identify products produced from higher welfare standard systems to enable consumers to make informed choices Finally as a member of the Committee on International Trade I would place particular emphasis on establishing internationally recognised animal welfare standards for trade SV Proper animal protection is a necessity in a modern society P There are big differences between the EU Member States when it comes to animal protection It may therefore be appropriate to have certain common rules for example where the transport of animals is concerned P The June List sees the EU as a union of values where ethical issues in relation to animals are important We are however doubtful about and indeed opposed to having an animal protection authority under the auspices of the EU The existing structures in the EU Member States should be sufficient If there were Community legislation the Member States would be forced to apply it If they did not do so the Commission in the first place and ultimately the European Court of Justice would have to take measures against the state or states that did not comply with the legislation P As so often it is very difficult to strike a balance between decisionmaking at EU level and decisionmaking at national regional or local levels There are however certain values that must be protected at any cost such as human rights and basic animal protection This should preferably be done at international level",

    "input": "Womens immigration debate The next item is the report by Rodi KratsaTsagaropoulou on behalf of the Committee on Womens Rights and Gender Equality on womens immigration the role and place of immigrant women in the European Union Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the report which I had the honour of drafting on behalf of the Committee on Womens Rights and Gender Equality is designed to help broaden the debate and our political action on the question of immigration by introducing the parameter of womens immigration P This parameter is becoming more and more important given that in the enlarged European Union there is a constant increase in women from various areas of the world who are immigrating either in isolation as independent economic migrants or within the framework of the migration of their families or for other reasons accounting for approximately 54 of all immigrants although this is not an exact figure P We all realise today that our objectives for development and social cohesion are directly linked to the management of migration flows by ensuring that immigrants are valued and integrated into our communities As such the femalisation if you will permit the phrase of immigration is a new challenge which must be studied and taken into account in all our policies Female immigrants either at a personal level or as members of their families can constitute added value both for our communities and for their communities of origin P In our report reference is made to the problems faced by female immigrants These problems have to do with the discrimination which they suffer on the labour market and in education and more specifically with the recognition of their qualifications and vocational skills and they are problems which result in unemployment and poverty Reference is also made to cases of violation of human rights such as violence and sexual exploitation which are matters which we have repeatedly debated and condemned in the European Parliament P We also wish to shed light on the problems faced by women in certain immigrant communities in which they are the victims of cultural and religious stereotypes resulting in their marginalisation Even worse are the cases of forced marriages and crimes of honour P The basic thrust of our report and the resolution which we propose is on the one hand the protection of the rights of immigrants and on the other hand their improved integration into the labour market and social life This means first of all the application of the acquis communautaire in order to remove discrimination prevent trafficking and make provision for family reunification and the rights of women as accompanying family members P The report recognises the right of the Member States to decide on the numbers and rules under which they accept immigrants into their country Within this framework of national legislation therefore we support respect for the rights of women their family rights and more importantly the rights of children in accordance with international conventions and protocols P Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen we recognise that integration is a complex and twoway process Therefore alongside this framework of reception and respect for the rights of immigrants which we must apply with proper coordination and use of all our policies we must cooperate seriously with the countries of origin and the immigrant communities in our countries so that we can prepare the proper integration of immigrants and more importantly of female immigrants because they are the ones who know least of all about their rights and about the benefits and obligations which derive from those rights These have to do with language with the authorities with our values with the potential for vocational careers and with the potential to participate in the educational system of their children Thus our objectives for development and prosperity and our fight for solidarity justice throughout the world and the protection of human rights will be better achieved P My warmest thanks to all the political groups whose participation enriched my work and helped us to prepare a text which is cohesive respects subsidiarity and the Community and international legal acquis and includes a courageous and indepth approach to the real problems and the real challenges Mr President I must truly congratulate the rapporteur on this report P I broadly agree with her remarks firstly as regards access to the labour market I believe that the role of women can represent one of the factors contributing to the creation in Europe of a genuinely balanced and comprehensive development and employment policy As you will know this is one of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and it is primarily a means of guaranteeing women a full role within society and a genuine life of independence and I therefore fully support the emphasis laid on the theme of employment P I also support the emphasis laid on the theme of the integration of immigrant women firstly as regards language learning Learning the language of ones country of residence must be a fundamental part of everyones integration be they men women children or babies In particular as regards women immigrants we note that there has been a delay in guaranteeing them genuine access to the languages spoken in their host countries and that is a factor that slows down and hinders integration P As the rapporteur rightly points out the theme of integration is connected to the crucial dialogue between cultures and religions I believe that the European Union is based on absolute values in terms of respect for the dignity of every woman and every man and that it is therefore impossible to accept under any circumstances acts that demean human dignity in this case womens dignity as they are the polar opposite of symbols of integration P I am concerned about cases in which for example women are made against their own will to wear submissive symbols of their female status such as veils that completely cover their faces and do not allow them to be seen Unfortunately these are symbols that sit uncomfortably with integration and suggest the subjection of women P I also think it absurd that in some European countries socalled honour crimes or as I would instead call them dishonour crimes take place and I will of course be doing even more to promote initiatives aimed at abolishing these crimes In my view they must be treated harshly not lightly because with motives like these they attack absolute values such as human life physical integrity and dignity P When applying the European directive on family reunification we intend to pay special attention to the prevention of forced marriages This is another theme on which I shall be working As you know this is a binding directive for the Member States When applying the directive at national level I shall pay special attention to forms of violence within the family such as forced and polygamous marriages which are not permitted by the laws of the European Union and of the Member States and to the guarantees made to women in the event of separation or divorce so that they cannot be singled out as secondclass citizens when their marriages break down P With regard to the directives on asylum seekers and refugees I believe that one aspect needs to be highlighted For the first time discrimination against women must be made to count as sufficient grounds for obtaining refugee status I believe that being subjected to violence within the family and to female genital mutilation or being at risk of being subjected to a forced marriage is enough of a reason for women who demonstrate that they are exposed to such risks to be granted refugee status P Finally in all sincerity once again I should like to point out to the rapporteur an aspect on which I harbour some doubts namely granting illegal woman immigrants exactly the same status as legal women immigrants I believe that there is an area in which absolute rights must be guaranteed to everyone without any difference in status It is clear that people cannot be denied rights to health care emergency medical treatment and a minimum level of subsistence just because for a given period of time perhaps while they are waiting to be repatriated they reside in a country illegally P There is certainly a basis of rights that they have in common but I believe that we should not go beyond that and mix up the two levels There is illegal immigrant status which is regulated and dealt with in one way Legal immigrant status is different To put them both on exactly the same footing sends out a dangerous message and it is obviously on this point that we are working in order to achieve a balanced European policy both on illegal immigration and on legal immigration on behalf of the PPEDE Group IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I gladly take the floor to endorse Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulous report even though I do so with a touch of sadness since last weekend we received a further tragic piece of news in relation to women namely the stoning to death of a woman in Baghdad on Saturday 21 October P I believe that everyone is aware of the fact that it is only by women having equal dignity throughout the world that a change can occur too in the major problems facing the world today It was in this frame of mind and with this firm belief that is to say with a firm belief in the value and the role that women can have now and in the future in enabling this world to move towards a solution of peaceful coexistence that I welcomed the work done by Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou in which consideration is given above all to the fact that women migrants are a somewhat special case P We would prefer it if this were not the case but it is In a world in which the division is still so clearcut and for a large part of the world there is still a division in terms of rights and duties I believe that treating women and men migrants in the same way would probably be a mistake just as it is always a mistake to treat different circumstances identically P The Union therefore needs to pay special attention to womens immigration also taking account of implications that do not in contrast characterise mens immigration I believe that we can find this focus in Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulous report which I accordingly intend to support on behalf of the PSE Group FR Mr President I should like sincerely to thank Mrs Kratsa for her commitment and her sense of cooperation This owninitiative report is in my view one of the most important reports dealing with womens rights that we have had to express an opinion on since the start of the Parliamentary term P The situation of women migrants has been overlooked for too long by our governments despite the fact that they are growing in number and that they now account for the majority of the people arriving on EU soil They are the ones who forge the first links between their families and nationals in terms of society and integration Indeed this report offers many guidelines aimed at putting a stop to the two forms of discrimination racial and sexual discrimination that these women often suffer P I am particularly delighted that a number of provisions have been included in this report that concern illegal women immigrants because they represent a subcategory that is deprived of its rights and thus made all the more vulnerable It is therefore vital that these women can benefit in whichever Member State they are resident from basic rights such as access to emergency health care legal aid and schools for their children as is the case in my country P Finally I am delighted that this report features another point to which I am particularly attached namely the status of women who arrive on EU territory within the context of the family reunification process These women often only exist in law through their husbands and are therefore placed in a situation of complete dependence This report calls for them to be granted an independent and autonomous status as quickly as possible and above all for this status to be automatically preserved in the event of the couple separating P I therefore hope that this report will be adopted by a large majority within our Parliament and that the ambitious proposals that it contains will not go unheeded on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen this report by Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou for which I am grateful puts plenty wind in the sails of womens rights particularly the rights of women immigrants and that was long overdue P We have for too long taken an attitude of cultural relativism towards women immigrants for granted I am glad to see that the report incorporates many of the things we have been pressing for such as the requirement that instances of genital mutilation be reported and that there be penalties if necessary under criminal law for forced marriages which have been long overdue I hope we will also be able to get language courses for migrant women made compulsory for language is an important component in integration and without them they will be unable to avail themselves of their rights P We must put a stop to the situation in which girls from families that have migrated to Europe are exempted sex education classes and sports which are mandatory for others and in which some of them are even taken out of school or forbidden to go there We need to be very determined about this and speak out about it loud and clear P We also see it as very important that women should acquire a legal status independent of that of their husbands and it is on this point that I would like to address Commissioner Frattini personally for I recently in a written question asked to be informed as to whether he shared my concern about the series of court rulings in various Member States that in the way in which they accord state benefits effectively endorse polygamy P I was quite horrified to be told by a Commissioner with responsibility for justice matters that the object of polygamy was the protection of women Bigamy is prohibited in Europe and I would welcome an answer from the Commissioner for I cannot imagine that he would knowingly allow it to be stated that polygamy was intended to protect women whilst certain forms of samesex partnership are outlawed on behalf of the GUENGL Group DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen I really am very grateful to Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou for her wideranging report which we in the Confederal Group of the European United LeftNordic Green Left fully endorse and adds a great deal to the information available on the rights of women migrants in the EU P Knowing as we do that women now constitute 54 of all immigrants it is quite utterly incomprehensible and shocking that the attitude of European governments towards them should betray such ignorance and that they should be doing so little to meet the specific needs that women immigrants have P My particular concern is that we should take this opportunity to note the flagrant deficiencies in the Member States integration policies with women immigrants being expected to adapt to the system in silence and without difficulty not making any demands and allowing the national labour market to make the maximum possible profit out of them When countries spend decades averting their eyes from the challenges that immigrants present and then make them carry the can for their inadequate integration I see that as no more than further evidence of ignorance and political blindness P I want to see genderspecific migration management that will be consistent in taking seriously immigrant womens rights to education health safety and independence and in ensuring that those things are available to more and more of them If that is not done we risk a further increase in the trafficking of women in the exploitation of female domestic staff in the social isolation of women and in domestic violence on behalf of the UEN Group IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done and in particular on the fact that she has highlighted some important priorities enabling us to ensure that immigration is primarily understood as twoway integration therefore involving social linguistic and cultural aspects that is to say integration based on mutual respect for rights and duties P Among the main rights that must be guaranteed to women migrants is that of preventing and combating honour crimes forced marriages genital mutilation or any other form of violent constraint and exploitation In this regard I on behalf of my group have tabled an amendment highlighting the need to carry out extensive information campaigns aimed precisely at women migrants so that they can be informed of their rights and of the bodies that they can turn in times of need P Finally the European Union needs at last to adopt specific provisions to encourage the Member States too to draft laws explicitly prohibiting some of the crimes and issues about which we have already spoken To conclude I should like to thank Mr Frattini for the commitment that he has emphasised this evening too a commitment that the Commission intends to put to use in addressing these problems on behalf of the INDDEM Group PL Mr President the very serious problem of emigration particularly by women due to increasing globalisation and the complexities of contemporary life should also be considered from the point of view of the irreparable damage to their countries of origin In addition I must mention the problem of increasing poverty in countries exploited by rich and highly developed ones There are certainly ways in which the opportunity to leave ones homeland can prove positive Nonetheless emigrants are cut off from a community bound together by its history traditions and culture An individual who could have contributed to increasing the common good leaves When that person starts life all over again in a foreign culture and language he or she is working for the benefit of another society Such people are often exploited because of their circumstances That is why it is vital to have the relevant legislation in place particularly regarding social protection and the individuals right to work The document under debate goes some way towards emphasising this An appropriate scale of values is also important where moral values are also given a place alongside purely material gain and human labour is considered in the broader sense of the word although the latter should not mean interference in the personal lives of women who want to have children and bring up families ES Mr President emigration is necessary and it also enriches our society in cultural economic and social terms and we are not going to deny that today It is the case however that it can cause us problems if we do not manage it properly P It should never be a problem because we must ensure that it is not one when we draw up these laws in all of the parliaments of the European Union If the parliaments are not careful however they may cause problems that turn into xenophobia and racism in our societies and that is precisely what we must prevent P A mistake has been made in drawing up this report since it has not just dealt with legal emigration but has treated legal and illegal emigration on the same footing This is a dangerous message because some of the things that this report says may have certain mafia gangs rubbing their hands with glee P Democracy which is the system that fortunately governs all of us is based on the freedom of the individual and that is guaranteed through respect for the law both the laws of the Member States because this problem is subject to subsidiarity and the Regulations and Directives that we have now and in the future P The important thing is respect for the law I fear that some of the amendments presented by the radical left do not respect the law of the Member States and run counter to equality democracy and the freedom of the individual P I would therefore ask the House to think hard about these amendments which are designed to attract mafias to confuse emigrants and to attract more illegal immigration They are going to be of little use to emigrants and European citizens as a whole given the draw effects given the comings and goings and dealings of mafias and given the fact that the criteria for granting residents permits are not clear P I would like to make an appeal to this House and the Commission with regard to cases of mutilation or forced marriage When it comes to talking to third countries and giving them money for cooperation we must if we genuinely want to protect women and womens equality demand of those countries before giving them that money that they respect minimum fundamental rights PT I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou We agree that European immigration policy must encompass the gender dimension and the situation of women in the Member States because they suffer from twofold discrimination sexual and ethnic as has been mentioned by previous speakers What is more they suffer from discrimination both in the host society and within their own community P The involvement of immigrant women in all areas of the host countrys social life is a vital factor in making them less isolated and in enabling them to help the younger generations to integrate For this to happen a number of barriers need to come down beginning with the linguistic barrier In some immigrant communities not only are women marginalised they are also forced into marriages and subjected to humiliating and cruel practices such as genital mutilation They also fall victim to honour crimes as Mr Frattini mentioned The Member States have a duty to do all they can to put an end to these criminal practices victims of which have justifiable grounds for being granted asylum IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I am grateful to Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou for her characteristic sensitivity and for the positive proposals on the role and status of both legal and illegal immigrant women in the European Union P We are concerned here with women migrants who are discriminated against in the workplace physically and mentally violated used as commodities for sex trafficking deprived of their freedom and passports held to ransom by patriarchal customs and killed in honour crimes I should however like to point out to us all that in reality these women are used and exploited by European families and European businessmen They are very often alone with the pain of having left behind their children in their countries of origin They work as carers alleviating the suffering and the loneliness of the elderly and the sick and they do not have any security I believe that we need to do a great deal in relation to this issue P These women represent a high percentage of the immigrant base and a major resource for the countries of Europe They are not just victims these women are all different and in recent years they have organised themselves into associations sought to establish relations and put themselves in touch with women from their host countries These women are requesting access to information health care and housing They want to have control over their lives and we must help them That is why we must mainstream the fight against discrimination and apply in every Member State the directives that the European Union has provided itself with and about which Mr Frattini was also speaking from the reception of migrants up to and including active citizenship The experiences of women migrants and their criticism of inequality are helping to pave the way for establishing democracy in relation to the few differences that exist PL Mr President we are currently witnessing mass migration which has a variety of causes There is economic migration where the aim is to earn more and improve ones standard of living That is the most common type of migration Then there is migration to reunify a family or to escape from persecution in the country of origin P Technological development has meant that it is becoming ever easier and cheaper to travel in todays world so the problem of immigration can only increase It is therefore incumbent on us to take appropriate measures to deal with the growing number of new arrivals particularly in Europe The sensible longterm solution would be to avoid discriminating against foreigners especially against women who are in the majority Too many immigrants are being consigned to the margins of society at present The Member States should create better conditions for immigrants to integrate into our societies whilst still retaining a pride in their origins This would allow us to preempt the problem of alienating immigrants which leads to frustration and sometimes to violent disturbances and very often results in a life of poverty SK The Commissions communication about the demographic future of Europe notes that over the next five decades the workingage population of the Member States will decline dramatically by an estimated 48 million people P Even an optimistic scenario involving a resumption of demographic growth and the discovery of new sources of productivity would still leave Europe needing a major inflow of new migrants estimated at 40 million people This may be the most serious challenge facing the European Union P The report we have before us for which I would like to thank Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou indicates that the position of migrant women plays a crucial role in the process This group of women deserves special attention not only because they are frequent targets of discrimination but also because they have a key mission in facilitating the integration of the first and second generations of migrants therefore the access of such women to education is of fundamental importance Against the backdrop of these challenges the need to develop common procedures for integrating migrants and to devise common procedures over immigration policy appears both urgent and unavoidable The diverging approaches adopted by the individual states give rise to unnecessary confusion P Developments in the area of human trafficking and human smuggling also point to a pressing need for clear immigration policies for transparency for unequivocal rules and for access to the common labour market A lack of legitimate opportunities clearly encourages illegal activities with illegal migrants being greatly exposed to all sorts of human rights violations and left without the assistance to which they would otherwise be entitled as victims P In our future deliberations however it is essential to make a clear distinction between asylum policy legitimate migration and illegal migration Confusing these notions would generate new and unnecessary misunderstandings DA Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I would like to thank the rapporteur for this very important and highly relevant report The nature of immigration into Europe has undergone a change Today more women than men come to Europe as there is a great demand for workers in the operational service and healthcare sector However the labour market in question is also characterised by a large grey economy in which the normal rules for pay working hours and the working environment do not apply Women therefore find themselves in a very vulnerable situation without social and economic protection and many of them perform jobs that do not provide the opportunity of becoming legal P Their vulnerability puts these illegal women immigrants at greater risk of being abused both physically and mentally while their illegal status in itself makes them easy prey for those who wish to abuse them and sexually exploit them in the workplace They are also particularly at risk of being denied their fundamental rights and they become victims of violence and discrimination in their everyday lives Many do not dare report assaults for fear of deportation P It is absolutely imperative to place the conditions in which immigrant women find themselves more firmly in the spotlight We need to ensure that the Member States take account through their legislation of the problems facing immigrant women Those women who are victims of peopletrafficking or who are exposed to violence should be given the opportunity of being granted temporary residence permits and have the right to legal aid and access to healthcare and social services irrespective of whether or not they have a legal right to stay in the country in question IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I concur with Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulous report and in this regard I would like to point out in agreement with her that the implementation in the Union of the directive on family reunification is unsatisfactory and that there is a need to amend the directive with the aim of reducing the time it takes to obtain autonomous status for spouses almost always wives and of guaranteeing that spouses status will be maintained in the event of separation divorce or widowhood P In addition I would like to emphasise the importance of several instruments of Community intervention in particular the Daphne programme since these instruments fill in the gaps in national policies which are all too often lacking with regard to the gender dimension in both policy content and data collection Finally the report calls for the risk of female genital mutilation to be included as grounds for requesting asylum P I agree with this but I believe that now is the time to include as grounds for requesting asylum other factors involving the repression of female sexuality such as homosexuality and socalled adulterous behaviour for countries in which these acts carry violent punishments I am thinking in this regard of stoning to death in Iran NL Mr President migrant women as a group vulnerable though it is are not so much a problem as an opportunity They are vulnerable because they may be exposed to discrimination not only for being women but also on the basis of their being Muslim Somali or Moroccan They are also vulnerable to domestic violence or because they do not speak the local language or are financially dependent on their spouses or fathers We must therefore support them by not letting domestic violence and honour crimes go unpunished but that cannot be done by imposing stricter rules alone Rights on paper are not sufficient for women they must also be able to assert them in practice because a woman who is dependent on the perpetrator of domestic violence will in practice not benefit a great deal from her rights on paper P That is why we must promote the financial independence of migrant women by for example counteracting discrimination within the labour market The economy benefits when more migrant women participate in the labour market Another opportunity we cannot afford to miss is the positive impact migrant women can have on the integration of their children in the new society That is why as a host community we must be open to support of and contact with migrant women for they too belong here I am pleased that Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou deals with these aspects at great length in her excellent report and I should therefore like to thank her for it ES Mr President I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and emphasise one consideration Any immigration policy must surely take account of specific gender issues but also the differences between immigrant communities since the causes of the double discrimination suffered by immigrant women and the problems resulting from it differ according to their reasons for emigrating P If women emigrating alone for economic reasons find work it is usually lowlevel work sometimes in undeclared jobs which gives them neither the independence nor the security they were seeking though it allows them to relate to people and to integrate further Nevertheless women emigrating for the purposes of family reunification usually stay at home with no opportunity to familiarise themselves with the host society or to learn the language and that hinders their integration and increases their isolation P The designation of 2007 as European year of equal opportunities for all and of 2008 as European year of intercultural dialogue must help to increase citizens awareness of the situation of immigrant women one that is always tough but which varies in nature and to implement policies to promote equality and integration in accordance with each different situation Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to make just a brief observation after having listened to many speeches which I endorse First Mrs Breyer I would like to tell you that I have always considered and will always consider polygamous marriage to be against the law and a serious violation of the right of women to choose freely I can therefore confirm to you that I will continue to move in this direction P Some of the Members who have spoken Mrs Angelilli and Mrs Morgantini have raised the issue of communication I believe if I may say so that giving a voice to immigrant women in a more direct and stronger way can be of great help even in drawing up stronger European defence policies Giving a voice means allowing these people to have effective means at their disposal to be able to speak and to be listened to Otherwise there is a risk if I may say so that the voices of these women may also be subject to a filter operated by the communities in which they reside P In many European countries cases of personal segregation and submission of immigrant women have been observed This is the group among the many with which I work from which I receive the lowest number of individual complaints When compared with other sectors connected with the protection of peoples fundamental rights individual violence against women in immigrant communities is the area in which the fewest complaints about specific cases are received Why Because there is a fear of reporting such cases because they are never communicated because the women themselves are subjected to violence so that they do not disclose the abuses that they are suffering within the free and democratic territory of the Member States Communication is therefore an absolutely central issue P Finally precisely to help this integration effort I would like to point out that in Spring 2007 I will be publishing a European manual on integration which will be issued in all the languages spoken in the countries of the European Union containing descriptions of cases of successful integration in the cities provinces and regions where they have been found By distributing millions of copies of this practical manual we will publicise positive examples so that they can be imitated These are examples coming from the world of local bodies I can inform you that up to now the sector for which I have the least information is precisely that of the integration of immigrant women P I am therefore appealing to you so that in the coming months I may receive specific examples both positive and negative on which I can take action Otherwise we will carry on making important statements of principle without being able to translate them into practical action something that I however intend to do The debate is closed P The vote will take place tomorrow at 1200 P Written statement Rule 142 Large number of immigrants with special emphasis on women face multiple discrimination and vulnerability to social exclusion This is the highest challenge for us how to integrate them into the society to help them getting access to proper education which helps them to wider employment facilities and to contribution to the development of the European Project P Proper legal framework is just one side of the coin Implementation of legal commitments by the relevant national authorities willingness of immigrants to respect fundamental European norms values and to become the integral part of the society is the other P Huge potential lies in successful integration policies since wider employment of immigrants could help with getting forward with Lisbon employment targets P No actions can gain success without proper and regular dialogue with immigrant communities The dialogues are perfect tools for monitoring integration processes learning about mutual interests intentions request as well as obligations determining and if necessary altering methods and of inclusion programs P The forthcoming European year of equal opportunities 2007 and the year of intercultural dialogue 2008 will be a useful and potential framework opportunity to provide immigrant societies with a wide range of information on their rights opportunities as well as informing them what Europe is expecting from them",

    "input": "Implementing measures level 2 of the Transparency and Prospectus directives debate The next item is the Commission statement on the Implementing measures level 2 for the Transparency and Prospectus directives Mr President allow me to address two measures proposed by the Commission on which Parliament will vote tomorrow They concern the postponement of the decision on the equivalence of third country accounting standards we aim to reach that decision by July 2008 and the general implementation measures for the Transparency Directive P I would first like to thank the rapporteurs for their efficient and helpful work on these important and sensitive matters Along with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs they have worked very constructively with the Commission and all parties concerned The careful work of Parliament has demonstrably improved the legal texts I would also like to thank the Committee of European Securities Regulators for its excellent work The draft measures now represent a balanced and efficient solution P Firstly on equivalence postponing our decision on equivalence will not only ensure that EU markets remain open while work on convergence is ongoing but will also allow us to work actively with United States and other third country authorities towards the elimination of reconciliation requirements for EU issuers abroad This is and will remain our number one objective P The additional two years will enable us to align the equivalence decision with the Securities and Exchange Commissions timeline in its roadmap towards eliminating the need for reconciliation between IFRS and US GAAP The United States authorities are committed to working towards the recognition of equivalence of IFRS and US GAAP With the new timing of the equivalence decisions we will be able to work in parallel towards common agreed objectives P In this context it is important to emphasise that nothing is predetermined We will decide on equivalence by mid2008 in the light of progress in convergence and it is certainly not a foregone conclusion that any specific GAAP will pass the test It has always been our priority to keep our options open I know that Parliament shares that objective Before 1 January 2008 we will have decided on both a definition of equivalence and the equivalence mechanism This will be done by way of comitology with the full involvement of Parliament P Exemption for issuers of professional securities from the need to provide narrative description of differences between third country GAAPs and IFRS remains an issue of concern We know that Parliament has doubts about this amendment Its aim is strictly to remove the ambiguity in the existing Prospectus Regulation We regret that we were alerted about this ambiguity only a few weeks ago but we are convinced that this amendment is necessary to ensure legal certainty P Secondly on the transparency measures the Transparency Directive is a major step towards integrated European financial markets that investors and the public can trust To achieve this it is important to complete the transparency obligations by adopting the Commission implementing measures today under your consideration P Parliament has made several proposals to the Commission for improving this text which I appreciate The Commission is ready to accept the substance of most of them unless this is not possible for technical reasons In particular Parliament raised questions on the notification to be made by market makers indicating their intention to make use of one of the exceptions to the Directive The Commission prefers a solution that limits the administrative burden and therefore the cost for market makers This is why the Commission is in favour of market makers filing this notification with their own competent authority only instead of with potentially 25 authorities I believe this solution fits perfectly with the simplification agenda that the Commission supports on behalf of the PPEDE Group Mr President in this era of globalisation we often bemoan Europes laggardness in setting global standards However International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS are essentially a European project incorporating a principlesbased system of accounting Much of the world will adopt that European accountancy standard It is appropriate that we allow third countries the time to adapt but 1 January 2009 is surely long enough a delay for that purpose P Until now our European companies have had to adapt to US general accounting principles while we accepted US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP in Europe With IFRS there is no reason for that discrimination to continue I am glad that the American authorities are intent on meeting the deadline for agreeing equivalence They even seem increasingly persuaded of the advantages of principlesbased accounting P Nevertheless finding commonality between a strict rulesbased system and a more flexible principlesbased system is not simple Both sides of the Atlantic agree that equivalence rather than strict convergence will be a suitable outcome That is why we call upon the Commission to stick to the January 2008 deadline to define what equivalence will be so as to make the ultimate time limit of 1 January 2009 a strict time limit P Any thirdcountry companies reporting in the European Union from that date on will have to report either in IFRS or an accounting system that is agreed to be equivalent and that agreement will be reciprocal P European accounts in accordance with IFRS will be accepted without adjustment in the US and other consenting third countries That will help European companies to cut costs and compete for capital in a globalised marketplace P My group looks to the Commission to pay due attention to the proposals in our joint resolution and to achieve a successful outcome of these important negotiations before 2009 on behalf of the PSE Group Mr President I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for his words about the report I believe it is the close working relationship that has developed between Parliament its various groups and the Commission that has helped to steady the rudder on this one Quite clearly we are entering a very dangerous time we have two years in which to get this right to measure the value of equivalence and reach convergence with countries around the world So the Commissioner is absolutely right to point this out not only to the USA but also to other third countries However the USA is certainly the big project that we all know about That is going to be the tough one and we are quite clearly afraid that the billions of dollars and euros between our two capital markets at the transatlantic level will be put in jeopardy if we do not get this right P I am very positive that we are on the right route and I believe that what Parliament has put forward has helped to strengthen the methodology also scrutinising the approach which will be involved in this particular battle P Looking at the bulk of this directive and the amendments from the supervisors and others in this House and I am very grateful to colleagues who have assisted on this issue I believe that we have not overburdened the business community That is and has always been vital You cannot use the term light touch all the time and then overburden business This is an important crossborder capital market issue and we need greater coherence and communication between the various operators within that market P We also need to ensure that investors are protected and that the right information is communicated to them in a relevant and timely manner These are issues which of course are now left to the Member State I think the Commissioner might agree with me that we should be using the most modern methods to communicate to investors P I do not have much time so I shall not pursue all the issues of this particular directive However I should like to turn to one recital in the original directive and bend the Commissioners ear That recital concerns the voluntary initiatives to help companies report what they pay governments around the world in the extractive industries As the Commissioner might remember and I am sure his departments will this was an initiative which was to help end corrupt practices It was aimed not only at places as farflung as Africa but also within our own borders Companies were meant to volunteer information about what they pay governments so that we in turn would know and investors would know just what money changed hands between governments and companies It was aimed at the extractive industries because it was clear that this was an area in which an awful lot of money was going abroad away from the countries where it should have been used P My final question to the Commissioner is to ask what he and his services might do to support that initiative I think this House would enjoy hearing again what your predecessor gave as a promise some years ago on behalf of the ALDE Group DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to say something about the implementing provisions of the transparency directive which Parliament since they are what are termed Level 2 measures is capable of influencing only to a limited extent That makes it all the more important that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted unanimously a draft report on the basis of which the plenary will now adopt a resolution of its own P By presenting a united front the committee has succeeded even before tomorrows vote in getting the Commission to accept some of its core demands The first is that market makers cannot be compelled to invest the financial instruments that they keep for marketmaking activities in a separate account although the supervisory authority can require a separate account if the market maker is unable to identify at any given time the relevant financial instruments when asked to do so P Secondly fair competition requires that the same conditions should apply to parent companies of management companies and investment firms from third countries as do to those from the European Union P Finally a distinction is to be drawn between transactions on stock exchanges and outside them for while in the former ownership is transferred when the contract is concluded and immediate notification is thus made not only possible but also necessary the conclusion of the contract and the transfer of ownership may be separate when transactions are concluded offmarket and it would be wrong to require notification as soon as a contract was concluded since a report at this juncture could unlike in the former instance have the effect of distorting the market P Despite Parliaments success on this negotiating front there are still areas and Commissioner McCreevy has indeed referred to them where the Commission has not yet done as Parliament would wish including for example such questions as firstly to which authority a market maker must apply for an exemption from the notification requirement when he reaches a specific threshold value secondly what is the minimum content required of nonconsolidated halfyear accounts not drawn up in accordance with international financial reporting standards and thirdly how it can be guaranteed that accountants will proceed in the same way when auditing halfyearly reports P I appeal to the Members of this House to vote yes tomorrow in order that we may seize our opportunity to get the Commission and the Member States to carefully examine Parliaments demands on these outstanding items and in due course accede to them Mr President as I did in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs I am today standing in for my colleague Professor Lauk the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats to whom we all wish a good recovery following the operation on his shoulder P It is on his behalf that I would like to thank not only the rapporteur Mr Skinner of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament but also the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Mr Klinz who like me hails from Hessen for their constructive cooperation It was the compromise reached by these three that made it possible for us in the committee to adopt the draft resolution unanimously P Even the Commission has been efficient Commissioner McCreevy has incorporated the essential points in his draft of the implementing Directive and following consultations made further modifications This solution makes for more transparent information on securities authorised on the regulated market P There are three points that the PPEDE Group saw as particularly important The first had to do with the need for the requirements applicable to halfyearly audits not to be excessively bureaucratic the consequence of which was that the figures for comparison purposes do not need to be submitted immediately upon the entry into force of the directive a more reasonable transitional period was decided upon Secondly where voting rights were concerned our intention was that subsidiaries would be listed both as part of their parent companies and as independent entities and we managed that too Thirdly where publication of necessity has to be accomplished rapidly it should be laid down in detail which media are to be used That was agreed to as well P These productive changes have prompted my group to endorse Mr Skinners report Both Mr Lauk and I look forward to it receiving broad support in this House tomorrow DE Mr President Commissioner the number of globallyactive enterprises is on the increase their need for comparable and globally recognised group accounts in order to gain access to international capital markets has been an agent of change in accountancy at the international level and the headlong progress of globalisation is making the harmonisation of accounting procedures across borders a matter of positive necessity The adoption of the International Accounting Standards Regulation was an important milestone in the creation of an integrated single financial market and in the harmonisation of accountancy in Europe P A developed capital market puts national economies in a better competitive position and studies have demonstrated that Member States with a high degree of share capitalisation and high stock exchange turnovers relative to their gross domestic product also achieve more growth and create more jobs That being so it is certainly desirable that the IFRS and American GAAP accounting regulations together with the accounting principles generally accepted in third countries should be made more closely approximate as an essential contribution to the development of standardised and internationally recognised accounting standards and hence to the integration of capital markets P Rather than aiming simply to do away with the existing difference in the accounting systems of the United States Canada or Japan the primary object of convergence must be the creation of highquality accounting standards which alone will be of lasting value and meet with unconditional acceptance It is of vital importance to European businesses that the SEC the USAs stock exchange supervisory body should recognise yearend accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS P The onesidedness in the recognition of accounting standards should become a thing of the past by January 2009 at the latest that is the only way in which European businesses will become more competitive LT The document being discussed is technically concise and clear we are speaking here about accounting standards Yet as we emphasised in our draft resolution in economic and political terms this issue is very significant and complex since in essence it concerns the role of the European Union in the global financial market P International financial accounting standards based on principles form a constituent part of our European financial model which will be adopted by developing countries as well Therefore the European Commission must take action in support of the application of such standards in developing countries promote their quality and European nature and in this way develop an image of the European financial market and offer various solutions not only in a technical sense P We should not forget that the United States also has a perfectly functional system of accounting standards Therefore whether we like it or not international and American accounting standards are presently competing in the market of the European Union that is we the legislators are competing P I believe that the European Parliament is ready for this competition but for businesses it is too costly to adhere to more than one standard and the developing markets feel confused They do not know which standards are to be implemented Consequently the European Commission should look for ways to harmonise the standards or encourage harmonisation of the standards at the level of appropriate bodies P We should not forget that it is not only a technical issue that we are discussing but rather the development of the global financial market and for harmonisation of the standards we need two things clear guidelines for implementation of harmonisation and a clear definition of what harmonisation really means P Some of us think that informal negotiations are more effective since no one needs to voice their positions in advance Different methods and tactics in negotiations are possible but I do not think the European Parliament would agree that decisions to be made in harmonising accounting standards should infringe on key IFRS principles their high quality and reputation It is out of the question for the European Parliament to make decisions without consulting Parliament and the players in financial markets DE Mr President I would like to use this opportunity to highlight two crucial points in both these reports The first is that formally speaking and as far as I am aware the new comitology procedure is not yet applicable in this area but I take it as read that the Commission will take due account of how this House votes since it will be applicable to new amendments in the future P The second has to do with the question as to how we should apply the IFRS standards in future an aspect that will become more and more important What I can say on behalf of our own group is that we in principle welcome IFRS standards as an international rule for European businesses but it has to be said that there are conditions attached to that Convergence must be achieved but that must also involve the European outlook and European priorities prevailing in future discussions on this subject It is for that reason that I am annoyed when I hear emanating from the Board of Trustees signals to the effect that a thoroughly critical view is being taken of the discussion as to whether and if so when convergence is achievable P The main question though has to do with how in future we are to devise further standards It is no secret that we have now had a debate on what are termed IFRS for SMEs The wheels are very definitely turning and discussions are in progress in the relevant bodies all of this has become quite separate from any political process and so I would like not only to encourage the Commission but also to urge them to monitor this process very rigorously in the interests of its being subject to political and democratic constraints and ensure that this House is involved P I am this Houses rapporteur on this subject area and I also have experience of Basel You can take it as read that this process will not work on the basis of an agreement being reached at international level and Parliament being left with no option but to adopt it that is why there needs to be close dialogue between Commission and Parliament The Commission is not merely encouraged but also urged to take active account of European interests and not to allow the Board to present it with faits accomplis in the way it has done before on other issues FR Mr President on the occasion of this debate on the adaptation of the Prospectus and Transparency directives regarding the road map negotiated by Mr McCreevy with the US authorities we are in a position to review the way in which the IFRS have been implemented The greatest caution must be exercised in relation to this matter One of the great contributions I believe of this Parliament is the way in which it ensured during the equivalence negotiations that there was genuine equivalence and not just a deadline that would elapse before it was finally pointed out that where there were once differences there would now be equivalence P As you know only too well Commissioner this issue is all about negotiation You have succeeded in getting the Americans to commit themselves to reconciliation at the end of the time period and when that time period expires you will remain emptyhanded if in the meantime this Parliament has not helped to consolidate the matter so that in the end we secure an acceptable recognition of equivalence P I very much regret the fact that we were unable before this plenary session to organise with our colleagues from the US Congress the videoconference that I proposed that my fellow coordinators accepted and that would have enabled us together with the US political authorities to hold the necessary debate on the latters ability to comply with this road map that you have made your own Commissioner Mr President I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues who have worked on these very difficult dossiers I welcome the spirit in which the implementing measures for the Transparency and Prospectus directives were formulated after the very tough MiFID procedure for which I was the rapporteur before the spring break P It is extremely important for the European Parliament to be able to have confidence in comitology especially now after the July decision We are delegating a large part of our decisionmaking powers to the Commission and we want to ensure that the legislation enacted in the Lamfalussy process gives the best possible technical quality as well as democratic legitimacy P However for Parliament to get rid of for example the sunset clauses which is the wish of the Commission we still need more guarantees on the improved procedure of the comitology decision and on Parliament having full influence on the secondlevel measures P For the record MiFID is a very important process and will certainly do far more than many people think for the financial services sector It is also a good example of the influence Parliament can have Industry and the market participants want us to use our powers more and people really respected the changes Parliament was making with that report I think the same thing will happen with the Transparency and Prospectus directives P It is very important that the European Parliament strengthens its powers in those areas Through this we will be able to give more support to the Community Sometimes there is unnecessary goldplating by the Council It has put forward proposals which are placing the single market at risk and I think that the Communitys soldiers the Commission and the European Parliament should march together on these issues as it would benefit the single market Mr President I shall briefly touch on the two topics P As regards the equivalence decision it is right to postpone it It is the most efficient way to promote the use of IFRS It gives us leverage in our efforts to obtain the removal of reconciliation requirements for EU issuers abroad as it ensures that EU markets remain attractive to foreign issuers It will benefit EU investors and issuers alike P I am aware of the concerns of Members of the European Parliament and others regarding many of these issues but a clear roadmap has been set out If there is goodwill on all sides we will reach a satisfactory end but in any event if we do not reach a satisfactory outcome then as we say in my country nothing is lost So I think that the prolongation of the time period is the correct decision for many reasons First so that we give ourselves here in Europe an opportunity to see how IFRS has been implemented in the various Member States and we will be learning in that process as well We have a clear commitment from our colleagues in the United States as to the roadmap and the time lines there and all things being equal we should reach a satisfactory conclusion But if we do not and if we are not satisfied then as I say nothing is lost Worldwide more people are moving to the IFRS accounting standards which Europe adopted as from last year so therefore it will be to our benefit P Concerning the great question posed by Mr Radwan and others about this question of convergence and equivalence let us see where we are in the few short years hence P On the transparency directive I shall deal with the point raised by Mr Skinner His point relates to a provision in the recital of the level 1 directive and this recital stipulates that payments by the extractive industries should be reported This as such is not the subject of todays debate but I can confirm that the Commission will monitor this issue P Concerning the implementing measures to the transparency directive I should also add that I understand some of the concerns expressed in relation to future developments In this regard the Commission commits itself to making a declaration that will be added to the minutes of the European Securities Committee on the date of the vote on the draft implementing measures It should state that the Commission undertakes to reexamine the issue of the auditors review of halfyearly financial statements once the work in relation to the international standards on auditing currently under development is sufficiently advanced P The Commission will also reexamine within two years of the final deadline for transposition the question of the minimum content of the condensed set of halfyearly financial statements that are not prepared in accordance with international accounting standards P The Commission also undertakes to conduct a review of how the regulated information is disseminated in practice pursuant to the obligations of the transparency directive and the future implementing directive This could be undertaken two years after the end of the transposition period for the implementing directive In this way we will ensure that the transparency directive tools are adapted to improvements in the market Pursuant to Rule 1032 of the Rules of Procedure I have received two motions for resolution P The debate is closed P The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon",

position 0623732006 C602742006 establishing an action programme in the field of lifelong learning Rapporteur Mrs Pack rapporteur DE Mr President Commissioner the new lifelong learning programme was intended to be a sufficient response within the framework of the Lisbon process to the challenges of the present day for education as we all together with everyone else constantly affirm is the beall and endall of our countries joint efforts at coming out top in globalised competition P The Councils cuts in the general budget have also had the unfortunate effect of cutting this multiannual

1437 billion over seven years but following negotiations we have been left with no more and no less than EUR 697 billion in the Financial Perspective Even so I want to thank all those Members who

goals and the bumpy return to earth P The lifelong learning programme is founded on the two programmes Socrates and Leonardo develops them further and enables working in synergy We have learned from the latest programmes our countries various national agencies have acquainted us with the problems that they had with the programmes and their views have all in fact been taken into account The lifelong learning programme includes the Comenius programme for schools its university counterpart Erasmus the Leonardo programme for vocational education and the Grundvigh for adults the Jean Monnet schemes for promoting European integration and horizontal measures P I have pushed for more funds than originally planned by the Commission to be allocated to the Comenius programme on the grounds that it is in my view the basis for all the other educational programmes and I have also emphasised the need for more cooperation in the border regions through a new Comenius Regio The programme puts new emphasis on student mobility between the ages of 11 and 16 with the invaluable experience of a school year spent at a school elsewhere in the EU We have also taken account in it of the needs of the children of migratory workers P The Leonardo programme promotes workers mobility and partnerships in ways that were formerly possible only through Erasmus Grants payable under Erasmus to university students are being increased to EUR 200 per month since the former grant was scarcely enough to live on we had originally proposed EUR 300 but that could have been sustained only by a drastic reduction in the number of participants and so we had to abandon the idea Erasmus also covers preparatory language courses and travel grants P Better financial provision than before has been made for the Grundvigh programme under which individual exchanges are now available The programme is conceived as a response to the current state of the labour market and to population trends P Whilst continuing to make grants to the College of Europe in Bruges the European University Institute in Florence the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht and the European Law Academy in Trier Parliament has also made provision for special grants to the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education Middelfart and the Centre Internationale de la Formation Européenne in Nice P I am absolutely delighted that participation in these programmes is still open to all members of the EEA and to Switzerland and Turkey and that the countries of the Western Balkans have recently been invited to join in that leads me to highlight the fact that it is now high time to say the least that the easier visa arrangement for SouthEastern Europe took tangible form P I would like to sum up by saying that the lifelong learning programme will help improve the EUs educational and training programmes make people more mobile support partnerships and cooperative efforts between regions structure the sharing of best practice and encourage the learning of foreign languages This is a programme that will help people gain a better understanding of the European Union make it easier for them to live together in it and practice intercultural dialogue and tolerance it is in fact the best communications strategy in the EU Member of the Commission Mr President as our German friends say Bildung ist mehr education is more It is a key to many more answers in life than are possible without education and it empowers individuals and societies to seek a better economic social cultural and political future and that is why I am sure that an integrated lifelong learning programme could provide many new opportunities in quantitative and qualitative terms because when we see it in combination with what we are doing in Europe all together it means much more than just a programme We are agreeing to create the lifelong learning strategies in Member States by the end of this year P We have a programme from January 2007 and we have a benchmark in our cooperation in order to increase the participation of adults in the lifelong learning systems in Member States As Mrs Pack said lifelong learning is not a luxury it is a necessity and I am sure that it gives individuals experiences which enrich their lives and improve their employability P Learning helps institutions to transfer knowledge from one to another across Europe to innovate to improve and to modernise It increases the transparency of Member States systems because when cooperation is open we see how systems are moving and becoming more and more compatible In short it is a valuable European instrument at the direct service of our citizens P The new programme will expand opportunities and will I am sure bring even more benefits So I am delighted that Parliament the Council and the Commission were able almost as soon as the financial framework was finalised earlier this year to reach agreement on the text of the programme decision I know it was not easy but if Parliament adopts it without amendment as your rapporteur proposes then the programme can be implemented on time from the start of 2007 P Given the complexity of the programme that is a major achievement If we compare the past with the current complex programme we can see the hard work that has been done I would like to extend particular thanks to Mrs Pack the rapporteur for using her great expertise and experience in the field to make it possible to reach an agreement so rapidly at second reading P On the text itself the Commission is fully in agreement that it should not be amended The financial envelope will be close to EUR 7 billion for seven years at current prices But we should also see it in broader terms where opportunities are growing I do not want to go into details but I frequently encourage ministers to look into structural funds to see how they could serve the mobility of students how other programmes like Erasmus Mundus could also help to build a more attractive European educational space P Our services have been working at full speed to have the implementation arrangements in place so that we can publish the first call for proposals under the lifelong learning programme before the end of this year and to ensure that the programme is more accessible and simpler for the end user Thank you for providing the possibility of enabling us to be so advanced at this moment on behalf of the PPEDE Group NL Mr President Commissioner it is of course a good thing that we can give the green light to these important learning programmes for as you so rightly say Bildung ist mehr education is more P Nevertheless I like the rapporteur have mixed feelings As Mrs Pack said before me I would argue that the Member States should never have cut back on these programmes not as drastically at any rate as has now been the case These are programmes that can help us make young people into European citizens the Europeans of the future Why ever have we been so brutal in the cutbacks for those programmes That is extremely shortsighted and in any event a missed opportunity for the EUs future I think that the Member States have given a perfect illustration of how to queer ones own pitch P I am sure that the Commissioner will agree with me when I say that every Erasmus student every Comenius student and I have met a huge number over the years every student ends up having a lifeforming experience It broadens their horizons improves their chances of employment brings them into contact with others they experience diversity and learn how to deal with it In that way these programmes also contribute to tolerance and needless to say to European citizenship P This House should in actual fact have thrown out this limited budget but that is a different matter of course It should have done that not least with social reasons in mind for quite a few students who come from more socially vulnerable environments and backgrounds will now find it much more difficult to take part in Erasmus There is no point though as somebody already said in regretting past actions It is too late for that We now have to pull out all the stops to make the most of what we have P I think that schools are sufficiently creative in seeking and finding additional sources of income to fund those programmes Industry possibly backed by the European Union or national governments may be able to help Why could businesses not sponsor exchange projects A factory that is local to me Ford could for example invite finalyear pupils or students for visits to their sister factories in different countries across the border It is just a thought but there may be some scope there P It is crucially important that we promote the exchange of students and schools to the best of our ability I would at this early stage express the hope that the Council and the Member States will realise that cutbacks on the forthcoming multiannual programme are bound to leave their mark on programmes like these and I wish you Commissioner the very best in your endeavours to implement the next programme 20072013 on behalf of the PSE Group DE Mr President Commissioner I am glad that we are making today a really big day for culture with five very major programmes for us to debate and also vote on which is not the sort of thing that happens very often in this House It does however highlight the importance and necessity of getting programmes of this kind up and running P Taken all together little more than one per cent of the total European Budget for 2007 to 2013 is available to us for all five programmes education youth culture media and active citizenship and that puts everything back into perspective and also brings us down to earth a bit I would like to say that these are ambitious programmes and we certainly could have done with more financial support for them as has already been said we had all planned something bigger and it is the Member States that are standing in the way P In general terms though I do believe that the lifelong learning programme is aimed in the right direction with simplification lump sums and more decentralisation in line with what we demanded Expenditure must be proportionate to financial support and building in the other EU support programmes on a horizontal basis would have been something else worth aiming for but I would also appeal to the Commission for things to be made simpler for the national agencies and for the applicants too The national agencies are in the course of being restructured and this process will certainly take up more time yet but here too dialogue and support from the Commission are called for We too should apply ourselves more to dialogue for there are still a number of problems left to be resolved P It is to be hoped that the trend towards increasing mobility will continue for we have set ourselves the target of three million students by 2012 and so we must make further strenuous efforts and demand many improvements The school systems also need to be analysed in terms of quality which needs to be guaranteed not only by the EU but also by the Member States and we have to demand that they do that on behalf of the ALDE Group LT I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Pack for an excellent report Lifelong learning is an integral part of any modern and developing society since the wellbeing of the nation is based on the education experience and skill that its population acquires In many cases the level of literacy and education determines a persons health and wellbeing as well as being a source of income and providing better opportunities for participation in social political and cultural life P At the moment adult education training and the professional development of working people are becoming increasingly important in Lithuania just as they are in the European Union as a whole although it has not yet become a hard and fast rule Unfortunately according to 2004 data our country is lagging far behind the EU average in terms of continuing education of people in the age range of 2465 years 28 in Lithuania as opposed to 42 in the European Union Many of the residents of our country agree that the main reasons motivating people to study are constantly growing labour market requirements and better selfimprovement and selfexpression opportunities however for half of our citizens their age has become a barrier as they believe they are too old to study Lithuania still holds on to a negative attitude towards older people pursuing knowledge In some cases in fact particular social groups are being discriminated against P In fact the attitude that only a competent employee is able to achieve good results contribute to the competitive advantage of the company and most importantly to gain a feeling of personal value and selfconfidence is already becoming dominant However it is generally public institutions rather than private employers who pay most attention to the training of their employees This is a huge problem since private companies employ almost 70 of all workers Constantly developing technologies and competitive challenges call for qualified employees and this must be an ongoing process P Consequently funding becomes an extremely important issue I believe that this programme and the aid from the European Union Structural Funds will help in reducing the present differences between the various Member States and the lifelong learning strategy will actually be implemented on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President I too will start by thanking Mrs Pack for the superb job she has done with this report That she is one of this Houses really experienced experts on educational policy has already been mentioned and that is evident from the priorities and emphases that she has added to this report P Europe is lacking in raw materials that much is a fact and so it is all the more important that we should develop the potential in the people who live here The growth achieved by both China and India is extraordinary and so is the number of graduates they produce If Europe is to stand a chance in the globalised economy we have to do more for education research and development I do not actually think that the European budget is focussed on the future we are still investing too much in traditional agricultural polices and too little in education development and research P Previous speakers have already lamented the fact that we are in this area budgeting for too little overall with the derisory figure of one per cent over the next seven years I find that very disappointing I really would have liked to see more We should be aiming at enabling every student in Europe to participate in the Erasmus programme which represents the big opportunity for young people for the experience of studying in different Member States will make real Europeans of them they will derive lifelong benefit from what they learn there and of course carry it over into their circles of friends and acquaintances and into working life That is what makes these experiences so very valuable not only to them as individuals but also to society EUR 200 is of course preferable to EUR 150 but it is not exactly what we could do with if we are to have a proactive education policy P I do though think Mrs Pack was right to say that we should start with the young and invest more in them All the studies show that to be the case That is why spending more on Comenius within the context of lifelong learning is the right thing to do on behalf of the GUENGL Group CS Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I warmly welcome Mrs Packs multilayered approach to drawing up this report I should like to highlight just a few aspects of the issue P One of the dangers of the modern world is that people are unable to adapt dynamically because of the narrowly focused and overly specialised nature of education which gives them a limited worldview and stops them from achieving their potential in the labour market The world has changed such a great deal that the traditional ideas of getting an education once and once only guaranteeing longterm employment and continuous progress until retirement has gone for good People must be capable of reacting more quickly to the way in which their environment is evolving and individual European educational programmes should enable them to do this P Lifelong learning helps people to keep pace with the development of science and technology and makes it easier for them to understand the world in general Alongside the development of educational programmes it is necessary to focus on ensuring that lifelong learning is not just a luxury for the chosen few but is accessible to all sections of society regardless of social status and gender on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President the purpose of this decision is for Parliament and the Council to set up an integrated programme in the field of lifelong learning to be implemented in the years 20072013 Amongst other things the programme aims to develop international cooperation between institutions of higher education and schools and also to promote the mobility of students staff pupils and teachers The programme is composed of four sectoral programmes namely Comenius for schools Erasmus for higher education Leonardo da Vinci for vocational education and training and Grundtvig for adult education P The original version of the programmes budget has been cut This has entailed cuts in terms of the quantitative targets for individual components of the programme and also the percentage share of resources As less funding is now available many of the actions previously planned will now not be undertaken These include fostering long and shortterm mobility of teachers within the framework of Erasmus along with study visits and innovative and experimental projects within the framework of the intersectoral programme Pursuant to the provisions of the new 20072013 Financial Perspective the budget allocation for the implementation of the lifelong learning programme has been almost halved It has been cut from the EUR 1362 billion originally planned to EUR 7171 billion This reduction in the programmes budget implies that there will be fewer grants available for projects and that there will also be fewer opportunities for poorer students to study at foreign institutions P In conclusion I should like to thank Mrs Pack very much for all her work on behalf of the INDDEM Group PL Mr President the lifelong learning programme is an excellent venture and the aims enshrined in its provisions are all relevant This programme is intended to implement one of the pillars of the Union namely the common social policy However as has been the case with similar excellent ventures the programme has fallen prey to funding cuts P One of the provisions of this programme involves supporting the contribution of learning to social cohesion which should lead to improved relationships between societies in our Community I put it to you ladies and gentlemen how can this be brought about when the new Member States are still bound by the transitional periods set for access to the labour market and therefore denied equal access to knowledge and technology Another key aim is also undermined namely that of increasing competitiveness mobility and innovation in the aforementioned market How can there be talk of such values when there is no mutual recognition of the equivalence of final diplomas thus putting individuals at a disadvantage at the very start of their career P In conclusion I would point out that once again a splendid and noble programme is deemed worthwhile and its provisions and aims are implemented mainly in the countries of the old Union FR Mr President Commissioner Mrs Pack has acted as the driving force behind the development of the programmes that we are discussing today with the integrated action programme Without her passion we would never have made the progress that we have made P Erasmus is certainly the most popular programme Despite the financial increase the new version will still depend on general mobility conditions such as the transferability of grants social security and the recognition of qualifications too While mobility does not guarantee that a persons studies will be integrated into his or her curriculum vitae taking the Erasmus route means that he or she is likely to have to study for an extra year Commissioner I should like to ask you where in the Bologna process is the inclusion of an Erasmus year P As regards the Leonardo programme the mobility of employees undertaking vocational training is of prime concern to the craftbased industries and small and mediumsized enterprises which also need to be made aware of mobilityrelated issues Making our workforce mobile that is what the Leonardo programme could do To that end the Commission should embark on campaigns to raise the awareness of businesses and should also ensure that the available budget is actually spent P I should like to point out that our ancestors used readily to move around Artists and craftsmen were the ones who travelled the most it was they who moved society forward Crossborder trade is the best way to make our fellow citizens forget about borders and to prove that we can do better P Finally I shall not stop repeating Commissioner that given the importance that Mr Barroso attaches to culture we should have the courage to make it a European policy Indeed those who want a larger budget must be able to submit political projects that are important and that are recognised as being important A revival of the debate on the best means of taking the Commission forward would provide a good opportunity for us to speak loudly in favour of such a policy ES Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I would like to join in congratulating the rapporteur Mrs Pack on her good work and all the members of the Committee on Culture and Education whose contributions have enriched this text P I would also however like to communicate my concern with regard to the implementation of the lifelong learning programme I remember how at the outset we were all falling over ourselves to improve the system of student mobility in Europe We all voted in favour of increasing the funds for the Erasmus Leonardo Comenius programmes etc in the conviction that it was a very productive longterm investment Providing the participants with economic facilities and at the same time simplifying the process for being awarded grants brought us closer to the objectives set in the Lisbon Strategy P As time passes however I am finding it harder to remain optimistic I note from surveys that fifteenyearold European schoolchildren have poor reading skills and show a high level of truancy and that many young people do not complete their studies within the time set In view of this information I wonder how we are going to deal with the challenges of globalisation If we are to create a knowledgebased society sustainable economic development and greater social cohesion we will have to establish a strong foundation from the outset and that can only be achieved through effective education In short in order to deal with future challenges it is crucial that we invest more in education P It is possible to improve the way existing programmes operate and to create new programmes If we make the effort the numbers will gradually prove us to be right but all of us must try to convince the Member States that we need to dedicate more money to education and training LT Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I would like to reemphasise that the programme being discussed provides citizens with more favourable opportunities for ongoing training and becoming active participants of the knowledgebased society P I think that the initial version we have returned to of the document proposed by the European Commission will enable us to more smoothly implement a programme integrating all the initiatives that are now operational in the area of education A unified system will ensure clarity and most importantly the possibility of avoiding redundancy in certain areas P Those states that are able to participate in lifelong learning programmes have experienced obvious benefits from this European Union initiative For example the Erasmus Leonardo da Vinci or Jean Monnet programmes are well known to the Lithuanian people indicating that European Union initiatives in the area of education are being implemented quite effectively P I hope you will support my contention that the lifelong learning programme is of vital importance both for promoting competition and entrepreneurship and in building a shared sense of European citizenship based on the values of the European Union such as mutual understanding and respect for human rights and democracy PL Mr President I fully support the programme for lifelong learning in the Union P We are always saying that Europe has to become more competitive Competitiveness must be built on the foundations of the knowledge triangle education research and innovation Education is crucial to this structure The Unions educational systems are the competence of the Member States but a betterintegrated European programme on education is very welcome We now have the Seventh Research Framework Programme and a new Community programme on competitiveness and innovation was launched very recently The angles of the Unions knowledge triangle are therefore well established Questions arise as to the sides of the triangle are these programmes adequately connected and do they support each other We must not think in terms of three separate programmes three distinct key aims for the European Union but in terms of a single joint aim namely a knowledge society P I value the proposed changes to lifelong learning such as the amendment of the Leonardo da Vinci programme to facilitate the transfer of innovation and the amendment of the Grundtvig programme to facilitate the innovational mobility of older learners All too often however the programme introduces innovative learning methods instead of opening up the field for the innovations themselves and for future researchers There is no system for recruiting highly talented individuals particularly participants in the Comenius and Erasmus programmes for young people and allowing them to continue their development within the framework of the Marie Curie programme The lifelong learning programme should also be in line with the research priorities of the Seventh Framework Programme All our actions should be aimed at ensuring the continuity of the knowledge triangle from school right up to the European Institute of Technology P I congratulate the Commissioner on this programme and urge him to ensure that these comments are taken into account during its implementation Member of the Commission SK I am sure there is no need for me to add much we should rather do more to implement what we have already agreed upon several times Education is more than a period in ones life We can deal with the issues of employment and growth through a much more coherent approach which is what the Lisbon Strategy is all about Education cannot be isolated from research and innovation which involves creativity and the promotion of knowledge It is also necessary to deploy knowledge practically and in innovative ways P I think that the Commission is heading in that direction The proposal to set up the European Institute of Technology provided evidence of this at last weeks summit in Lahti There is further evidence of it in the whole programme and the policy of putting education at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy and aiming to shape Europe and generate knowledge for growth and employment P The four pillars of the lifelong programme have very inspiring names Comenius Jan Amos Comenius Leonardo da Vinci Erasmus of Rotterdam and Grundtvig In my opinion this is an important signal We will not be able to solve all financial problems through this programme but we can provide a lot of inspiration in particular for measures at national level so that education which is within the competence of the Member States becomes the focus of national approaches or of the Lisbon Strategy There will then be much more money available and we would certainly appreciate having more allocations for mobility and cooperation in the area of education P I think that the upcoming 20th anniversary of Erasmus the most popular programme in the European Union is a great opportunity to evaluate the situation but also a challenge for us to do more together for education young people and the future P With regard to visas and cooperation with other countries as of 1 January 2007 Member States should implement or transpose the visa facilitation decision for students lecturers and researchers throughout the European Union with the exception of the UK Ireland and Denmark P In response to whether we need harmonisation or some other kind of policy I would say that what we need is complementarity and compatibility rather than the harmonisation of our education systems and this is gradually being achieved through measures such as the Bologna Process P We are constantly calling not only for more investment but also for better investment The first priority is for better investment whereas more investment comes second Better also means raising publicprivate funds This often takes the form of mobility or education sponsorship on the part of businesses and industry P So much for my reflections in response to some of the points that have been raised May I once again thank the rapporteur Mrs Pack the entire committee and all those who contributed for their high level of consensus and commitment The debate is closed P The vote will take place on Wednesday at 1230 pm P Written statement Rule 142 Mr President I congratulate our rapporteur for her work in steering this important report through Parliament Next year Erasmus celebrates its 20th anniversary having been brought into being by one of my predecessors Winnie Ewing when she was chair of the Culture and Education Committee and there is much to thank her for Since 1987 over 12 million students have completed exchange courses at universities outside their own countries In the 20042005 academic year over 144 000 students took advantage of the opportunity provided by the Erasmus programme to continue their studies in a country other than their own The benefit and invaluable cultural and linguistic experience this provides for students is second to none As a former Erasmus exchange student myself I can vouch for that P Erasmus has been one of the successes of the EU in demonstrating its relevance But while the uptake for students coming to Scotland has been encouraging with 2163 during 20042005 the number of Scottish students going abroad to study has been far less standing at 1018 I want to see more Scots taking part in this programme and benefiting from the opportunity to study abroad Erasmus is one way in which we can encourage our young people to have an international outlook P Annex Commission statement P The Commission should like to draw the legislative authoritys attention to the need for the financial package mentioned in the basic act to be expressed at current prices and for this to be done no later than its final publication in the OJ This corresponds to the standard budgetary practice and will help to ensure with all due transparency that the legislative authoritys decision is complied with For the Action programme in the field of lifelong learning the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 6 970 million",

    "input": "Europe for Citizens programme 20072013 debate The next item is the recommendation for second reading on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the Council common position C603162006 for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 20072013 the programme Europe for Citizens to promote active European citizenship 0957512006 Rapporteur Mr Takkula rapporteur FI Mr President Commissioner I would first like to thank everyone who has been involved in the deliberations on this report especially the shadow rapporteurs and members of other committees who have made their comments I wish in particular to thank my esteemed colleagues and coordinators Mrs Pack and Mrs Prets because being a member of the smallest group I would not have been able to produce this report without your support I am also grateful for the excellent team spirit and cooperation which you have shown in our committee P The programme consists of four areas of action The first is a Europe of active citizens which includes towntwinning and citizens projects Towntwinning has already proven to be a success story and I hope that this success story will continue and go from strength to strength with this programme Furthermore the citizens projects are very important One central idea in establishing this programme was that the European Union could indeed have a grassroots programme which would not be elitist and which the people the citizens of the European Union could think of as theirs P The second area of action is active civil society in Europe This could help provide structural support for EU public policy research organisations thinktanks and for NGOs at European level as well as support for projects coordinated by these NGOs I think it is vitally important that open adult education centres and vocational colleges nondegreebased organisations have a bigger role because these are just the sort of organisations that are best at reaching out to ordinary people at grassroots level This way this programme will hopefully also open its doors to people all over the European Union and they will feel it is something relevant to them P The third area of action is Together for Europe supporting high visibility events studies and information and dissemination tools As we know it is important to promote the European Union in the appropriate way and to bring it closer to people because there are shortcomings too in the area of information and communications People feel that they are a long way from the decisionmaking process and therefore they feel that European Union programmes are remote We have much work to do to bring the Union closer to the people by providing information and through various events P A fourth area of action was added to the programme and this is the preservation of Active European Remembrance There was intense discussion on this in our committee We finally hit on the idea that when this action was transferred from the Culture 2000 Programme it was just this memory of Nazism and Stalinism that we needed to preserve so that no horrors like this can ever occur again in Europe We think that it is very important that future generations are also able to understand what the European identity is what peace is and what stability is and it is therefore also important to guarantee active remembrance P It would also obviously have been desirable for the budget to be uptodate when this programme was being put together We know however that for some reason there is not as yet enough sympathy in the European Parliament or at least not in the European Commission or the Council for cultural projects or enough appreciation of their importance I myself believe that culture and our civil society create a basis on which a dynamic and thriving economy can also be built We on the Committee on Culture and Education being cultured people should ensure that the budget will be more effective in the future This time we were obliged to some extent to cut it from the Commissions original proposal under pressure from the Council but I hope that the programme can be got underway here and that it will become a success story P Finally I would like to express my gratitude for the cooperation and general understanding that has been reached between the Commission the Council and Parliament I am especially glad that NGOs open universities and amateur sports clubs have been included in the programme I hope that when this programme starts in early 2007 it might become another success story P Applause Member of the Commission Mr President not more than half a year ago I was here speaking on the same programme asking for a quick agreement At that time the proposal had a different title Citizens for Europe Now after half a year we are here very close to the final decisions with the new title Europe for Citizens coming from your input but I think this was a remarkable shift both in consensus but also in the readiness top progress towards finalisation P This programme is very important for citizens and civic society organisations I am very satisfied with the quality and intensity of negotiations between institutions that have taken place on the programme I would like especially and sincerely to thank the Committee on Culture for its efforts to accelerate the procedure and the rapporteur Mr Takkula for his excellent work and cooperation P Those steps in the interinstitutional procedures were accompanied by informal trilateral meetings They resulted in a compromise acceptable to all three institutions in the form of four amendments on which you will vote on tomorrow P Concerning the budget we agreed to allocate an amount of EUR 190 million at 2004 prices which means EUR 215 million at current prices This is less than the Commissions original proposal but it still enables us to retain the structure of the programme only reducing the number of outputs P I would like once more to express my regrets about the introduction by the Council of a supplementary step to the comitology procedure This will slow down the selection procedure for certain categories of projects However with a view to reaching a quick agreement the Commission accepted the position taken by the Council and supported by you Today you are envisaging adopting four amendments two of them concern the budget breakdown between different actions one is technical and will accelerate the entry into force of the programme and the last one adds the promotion of tolerance to the objectives of the programme That is fully in line with the programmes philosophy P Let me repeat that the Commission fully supports the agreed compromise and therefore encourages Parliament to adopt those four amendments If you adopt them the Council has committed itself rapidly to adopt the whole agreed text and the programme should then be able to enter into force by 1 January 2007 P I can assure you that once the programme is adopted the Commission will take all necessary steps to implement it as efficiently and as effectively as possible Indeed my services are already actively preparing its entry into force We will work in close cooperation with the Programme Committee and in close dialogue with the organisations involved in this programme P I would like to finish by repeating what Mr Takkula said ie that culture forms the basis for our societies which is why we defined the legal base for this programme in combination with the culturerelated Article 151 of the Treaty It was the subject of many discussions but I believe it is the right proposal and the right line to take for future culture and citizenship to go hand in hand towards responsibility on all levels of our public and private engagement in our lives as well as in the spheres of enlargement and the future of our Union Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen let me start with a word of thanks to the rapporteur Mr Takkula for this very fine report on Europe for Citizens Now that the overall amount has been reduced to EUR 190 million from the EUR 235 million that this House and the Commission originally agreed on that is the amount with which for lack of any understanding on the Councils part we are obliged to manage P We support the rapporteurs two amendments one of which aims for a 2 decrease and the other at an increase by the same amount We are particularly glad to see that the new Action 4 which has to do with memorials keeps alive the memory not only of the crimes committed by the Nazi regime but also of those committed under Stalin P I would however Commissioner like to address one other problem one that has been raised by those who benefit from the programmes and by those who run them This House wishes to point out that its resolution of 5 April 2006 referred to both conferences and seminars and the bilateral seminars working parties and meetings of experts are essential components of the partnership effort in terms of qualifying the programmes and those who work on them and grants should be available for them in the same way that they are for multilateral conferences P Furthermore this House takes it as read that the Commission will in the course of the applications procedure accord equal treatment to local authorities and civil society organisations and the object of that is that the Commission should be prevented from doing as had originally been planned and imposing additional requirements such as guarantees and special bank sureties on too many other social organisations which they would find it difficult indeed impossible to meet on behalf of the PSE Group NL Mr President first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr Takkula for his excellent report and for his good cooperation I welcome this programme with open arms for it will benefit the public us in this House and the European Union as a whole After all the Europe for Citizens programme finally indicates that the citizens should not be there for Europe but the other way round Europe is there for its citizens Only when the European Union obtains concrete results for its citizens can we count on support for this European Union Needless to say we can try to enhance the bonding process between our citizens and the EU by organising exchange programmes and events but it is always more successful if the citizens come up with their own initiatives which is where this programme comes in P I am grateful to Mr Takkula to my fellow Members in all the groups as well as to the Commission and Council for the good working relationship we have enjoyed in dealing with this dossier There is however something that I need to get off my chest The European Union has recognised that there is a chasm between its citizens and the institutions This programme is in recognition of this and tries to make amends in this respect Why then have we skimped on this programme and other vitally important programmes Talking about citizen involvement without injecting money into it is of course a waste of time P I will in any event do all I can to promote this programme to people in the Netherlands I hope that other Members will bring this programme to peoples attention in their own countries too If we all made a huge success of it next time the Council and the Commission may have no choice but to increase the budget of the Europe for Citizens programme to an acceptable level P There is no doubt that the Europe for Citizens programme can become a success In Europe there are many people who are prepared to actively work on Europes integration This programme allows them to take part in the process and get organising It is therefore enormously important for the European citizens to have the sense of being involved in the EUs development That is what this programme makes possible My appeal to the citizens of Europe is therefore that they seize that opportunity on behalf of the ALDE Group Mr President I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work in producing this report on the promotion of active European citizenship P Many of us who genuinely care about the future of Europe believe that active citizenship will play an important role in the continuation of the European project The EU is a work in progress progress from centuries of division to a time of mutual cooperation That mutual cooperation is for the benefit of all our citizens Otherwise the EU has no raison dêtre P It is also important to understand that this mutual cooperation is not just between Member States That is certainly important but it is not enough There must also be mutual cooperation between our citizens so that they too are an integral part of the process not as an audience but as actors on the stage not as observers but as participants We are looking here at participative democracy alongside representative democracy sometimes an uneasy alliance on both sides but one we must promote because otherwise we just pay lip service to our citizens and they deserve much better than that P I am pleased to see the inclusion of nonformal education programmes in this report Perhaps we might extend that to the recognition of volunteering activities through the provision of a European volunteering passport Volunteering plays an important role in active citizenship because many of the activities earmarked in the report such as town twinning civil society organisations and amateur sports organisations involve volunteer participation Intercultural dialogue must also be supported All of us have our prejudices our misconceptions about others and it is only by engaging with each other that we begin to recognise each others humanity and that is the foundation of mutual cooperation and mutual respect P My only regret is that the funding provided will not be sufficient to accomplish the huge and important task we have set ourselves However I agree with the previous speaker let us roll up our sleeves and get on with it on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteur Mr Takkula P I am delighted that there has been a rethink in the naming of the programme originally called Citizens for Europe and that it is now called Europe for Citizens This means that the onus is on Europe too and that it must reach out to the public The aim is to reach and involve citizens to meet them locally to take them seriously to listen to their concerns and to win them over to Europe and the debate on its future P Towntwinning activities are a good means of contributing to this A general discussion on European globalisation blues will also form part of the debates within this programme however as will the question as to how we can strike a balance between excessive neoliberalism on the one hand and statism or excessive protectionism on the other P I should like to mention a further point namely the inclusion of extermination camps be they Stalinist or Nazi in this programme I believe that a further reappraisal of the history of this particular European totalitarianism which destroyed Europe and brought great unhappiness to the whole world is politically appropriate Learning the appropriate lessons from this and building a genuinely open and democratic Europe remains one of our challenges for the future The programme is also intended to make a contribution to this on behalf of the GUENGL Group PT We share the concerns and the objectives of the Europe for Citizens programme and accordingly voted in favour The truth of the matter is that this European Union is short of neither Europe for businesses nor Europe for the market Far from it in fact We have had far too little Europe for citizens too little support for a European citizenship with an active voice in the major themes on which we are building our shared territory In this area decisions lack courage laws are thin on the ground and support is virtually nonexistent This programme alone will not in itself reverse this situation We support the programme but we are also critical of its budgetary weakness A 60 cut on the original proposal is clearly excessive but very much in keeping with the restrictive and outdated rule whereby all programmes in the field of education culture and youth are underfunded Chronic underfunding is not the result of any scarcity of resources but of a deliberate policy strategy on the type of Union that the Member States want to construct which resurfaced when the financial perspective for 20072013 was adopted to the detriment of areas such as culture P There is no such thing as effective policy without adequate funding Words and good intentions are all well and good but the policy must be much more than this P Mr President Mr Takkula we agree with you as regards your preference for transparency in granting funding for projects This should be based on clear criteria with open application procedures and impartial adjudicators Unfortunately this has not been the case We are pleased to note that we will gradually see an end to the scandal of funding being granted outside the application system to organisations that place themselves above fair competition and are still receiving substantial longterm funding This damages the Unions image The fact that these organisations are often associated with important personalities who made their careers in the European institutions only makes matters worse I come from a southern European country and I must say I warmly welcome the fresh air blowing in from the north in relation to this issue P Lastly as regards the new line of funding on memorials to dictatorships I should like once again to express our complete opposition to the criteria that have been followed The exclusion of memorials to dictatorships that for decades oppressed various peoples in the south of Europe shows a lack of respect for the thousands of victims of these dictatorships Without the victory over the fascist regimes of southern Europe the borders of the EU would be quite different today and its territory smaller The exclusion of these dictatorships and of the memory of them sends out the wrong message to the citizens suggesting as it does that there are some dictatorships whose memory should not be forgotten and others that are not so bad or even acceptable It also sends out the wrong message to the world A pragmatic attitude to dictatorships is indicative of double standards and poisons and discredits the EUs external policy A criterion based on unambiguously democratic principles would have been better than a mediocre meanspirited criterion that was unable to look beyond the scarcity of funding on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President we are all playing our part in the creation of the European Union but we bring with us our own particular outlook experience and observations These make it clear that although we have much in common there is also much that divides us P Many European citizens are sceptical about the Union and dubious about European integration As a result whilst some are seeking ways of rapidly bringing about European integration others feel that if this process has to take place at all it must do so slowly and be carefully thought through They feel it should be a longterm process that respects national traditions and takes account of contemporary experience P I welcome the fact that the Europe for Citizens Programme contains many of the suggestions made by Members of this House in particular in the part concerning memorials to the victims of dictatorship Financial support is available for places linked to the Nazi regime and also for memorials to the victims of Stalinist crimes Much was said during the debate on the programme about how little the citizens identify with the process of European integration A distinction was rightly drawn between citizens of the old new and future Member States Insufficient consideration was given however to the important fact that while one group aims to create a single one size fits all European model of national identity as quickly as possible another inclines towards a Europe of nations where the sense of national identity would be respected The latter group would determine common cultural values on the basis of cultural diversity and dialogue on behalf of the INDDEM Group PL Mr President the draft document on Europe for Citizens is an example of detailed wishful thinking Someone dreamt up the idea that if more money were invested in awareness raising informing and including Europeans in Union events the citizens would be brought closer to the Union and involved in European integration P A similar argument was adduced in the Soviet sphere of influence where our lives were dominated by the single orthodox Socialist ideology It was believed that pouring money into events would guarantee the development of socalled Socialist awareness The Soviet system tried hard to create a single orthodox Soviet identity in the minds of Russians Ukrainians Georgians and others Nations were deprived of their right to their own distinctive identity P Someone has now decided that it will be easier to integrate Europeans if the relevant document is entitled Europe for Citizens instead of Citizens for Europe We have seen all this before Soviet citizens were not supposed to be for the Soviet Union The Soviet Union was supposed to be for them What was actually the case was that for Lenin Stalin and others people thinking and acting as Russians Poles or Hungarians were a hindrance People brought up in Soviet multiculturalism were more malleable and more amenable to becoming slaves in the service of the empire P We would do well to remember that the genuine freedom of individuals and nations arises out of national cultures where it has its source That is why this document should be consigned to the dustbin along with the legacy of the former Soviet Union Mr President our sense of citizenship like our sense of identity arises from our history our culture our language and our experience of life It comes from the bottom up This citizenship programme is topdown It seeks to create a sense of citizenship where none exists As such it is doomed to fail and it is wholly improper P I was born a British citizen I never asked to be a European citizen I do not want European citizenship and I totally reject and repudiate it The European Constitution which incorporates the concept of EU citizenship has been roundly rejected in France and Holland and it would be rejected if it were voted on in the United Kingdom The promotion of this failed concept is therefore highly contentious We are using taxpayers money to promote one side of a hotly disputed debate and that is wrong undemocratic and disgraceful I call on colleagues to reject this report out of hand Mr President it is a very important achievement to have a common position adopted by the Council on this Europe for Citizens programme and I congratulate the rapporteur Mr Takkula on his work and dedication and in particular for improving the scope of the programme P I want to dwell on two aspects of the programme town twinning and the memorials to the victims of the twin dictatorships of Hitler and Stalin I would urge Commissioner Figeľ to coordinate his work with that of his colleague Commissioner Wallström who is responsible for information and public relations in order to maximise the impact of this extremely important report and programme P Firstly on the towntwinning movement I could not disagree more with the previous speaker In my own country there are towntwinning associations which have existed for 50 years and others which have been newly founded I wish that the Commissioners because they are the only people who can do it would give fair free and open publicity to the dedication and voluntary work of these organisations To hear in my own county town of Hertford the German French British and European anthems sung by local citizens and by school children was infinitely more eloquent than the absurd antiEuropean propaganda that we are given to digest in much of our popular press We are in a battle for the hearts and minds of public opinion and we cannot allow the sceptics simply to have the best tunes We have got the best tune but we have to proclaim it P Secondly on the memorials I am delighted that Mr Takkula has included the victims of Stalinist crimes because half our European Union was subject to that dictatorship and just imagine the disbelief of new citizens of the European Union that their suffering should be neglected whereas those who suffered from Hitlers Third Reich should be commemorated P Therefore I commend this report and this programme to Parliament and the entire European Union and let us hope that this time we win the argument Mr President Hungary has commemorated the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution Old women and men remember the revolutionary events they witnessed and young people try to image what happened 50 years ago when the antiStalinist revolution united the Hungarians the reformed communists and the democrats But some thousand extreme rightwing rioters changed everything last night They attacked the police burned down shops some of them threw stones and bottles at a synagogue shouting antiSemitic slogans under the banner of the Hungarian Nazi movement P These tragic events show us how important it is to remember and to allow us to remember the tragedies and crimes of the 20th century Mr Takkulas report rightly calls upon us to commemorate the victims of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes But it is not enough to commemorate we have to combat presentday extremist ideologies as well Stalinism is over thank God but the danger of the neoNazi extremists is still alive Every democratic party has to condemn extreme rightwing ideologies and violence We have to learn from the lesson of the Weimar Republic The smallest concession to the extreme right could lead to huge tragedies PT Mr President ladies and gentlemen the Eurobarometer data are extremely worrying Most EU citizens are unfamiliar with the Unions institutional system The Commissions role is seen as either vague or very vague The Council is virtually unknown as an institution The citizens perceptions are extremely muddled Many citizens are incapable of expressing a considered opinion on Europe There is one salient fact running through these data the citizens want more information and have chosen television as the best means to receive that information P We have seen that theoretical or bland citizenship some vague feeling of belonging makes Europe weaker Europe is viewed more as an abstraction than an important presence in our lives P What we need is not theoretical or bland citizenship but strong practical citizenship a feeling of loyalty a feeling that Europeans can identify with a Community whose destiny is encapsulated in its universal values Without this feeling of loyalty and identification no political project can succeed P Citizenship is the biggest challenge facing a postnational society such as Europe European citizenship is a product of reason not of tradition It needs to be constructed it is not born spontaneously This is a new political era one characterised by sharing and by new forms of governance It is indeed a time in which the sovereignty of States has shifted to a sovereignty of people P Be that as it may how ironic is it that the policy does not encourage people to identify with a project that places them at the centre P The Citizens for Europe Programme does not provide an adequate budget or an incisive enough information strategy Publicity about the institutions especially on television showing the institutions and the European project must not be delayed any further P Explaining Europe is vital in forming a feeling for Europe SL The greatest achievement of the European Union to date has been guaranteeing peace and coexistence amongst the nations of Europe However critics of the European Union frequently complain that the work carried out by European institutions is too expensive and too remote from its citizens P The Europe for Citizens programme offers new initiatives that will help to bring European citizens closer together including those who are not enrolled in any type of formal education but who wish to gain new knowledge and experience and forge contacts with other citizens of the European Union Participation in this programme is open to twin towns so the programme will also be accessible to the kind of people who do not take part in major European Union projects every day However indirect contact and personal experience can contribute appreciably to an understanding of the Union as I have noticed when I have met groups from Slovenia who are visiting the European Parliament P Sport too has a great power to unify and can communicate across linguistic boundaries Participation in toplevel sport is fast becoming the preserve of an increasingly narrow circle of people This programme supports international participation by the wider masses Major projects bring major benefits but smaller projects bring great pleasure to many individuals P The programmes will be all the more successful if citizens can access them easily and if they do not have to fill in mountains of forms every time they make an application Our citizens often become disenchanted with the European Union precisely because they encounter too many administrative obstacles when attempting to secure funding This is why we must endeavour when offering worthwhile programmes to streamline procedures and to ensure greater awareness of such funds and easier access to them at both European and national level Member of the Commission SK I would like to thank you for all your contributions and particularly for the commitment you have shown concerning the importance of working together as fellow citizens of the EU when dealing with certain issues or ideas P The programme itself constitutes the legal basis for implementation and will define the conditions that the Commission too will be required to meet It is important that these conditions be known and implemented as soon as possible Parliament will be involved through the Steering Committee and programme evaluation P As regards voluntary work and improvements in the recognition of informal education we are interested in and are striving for progress in these areas particularly from the perspective of young people This will be done through the Youth Pass which should add greater transparency and value to voluntary work P I agree that it is necessary to raise awareness of the results achieved so far and of the successes and the nature of this cooperation particularly for example in the area of cooperation between towns and cities More than 10 000 municipalities in the EU are cooperating under the civic programme Three weeks ago we awarded 11 golden stars for the best projects those which are inspiring and which help real people solve real problems in towns and cities across the EU Such projects might be more widely copied if people were made more aware of them In this respect I agree with Mr Beazley P The programme will also provide opportunities for special events I would like to refer for example to last years celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the Polish Solidarity Movement that were funded from a special budget line and heading It will be possible to implement this approach over the next seven years using the Citizenship Programme P In conclusion as well as a businessfriendly or marketfriendly Europe we also have a real need for a citizenfriendly Europe that is both welldisposed and helpful to its citizens having as its foundations civil society and a certain degree of maturity I would also like to emphasise that the name of the programme is but one side of the coin as the relationship between citizens for Europe and Europe for Citizens is a very important one This is our space and at the same time it serves us We need to shape and develop this space and to take responsibility for it P Once again I would like to thank the rapporteur and the entire Parliament for a very constructive approach to the programme The debate is closed P The vote will take place on Wednesday at 1230 pm P Written statement Rule 142 HU Mr President ladies and gentlemen Please allow me to offer my congratulations on the creation of the Europe for Citizens Programme 20072013 and to congratulate Mr Takkula on the most recent version of the report P Europes institutional social and political relationships today form a dense network the threads of which have become even more closely interwoven since enlargement Forming active European citizens plays a key role in this process and the presence of such citizens is indispensable in order to ensure the continued democratic and balanced development of the European Union P If we are to have European citizens who take responsibility for themselves and their society we need to emphasise what today are considered to be lost values such as freedom fairness tolerance and solidarity which constitute the fundamental values and cohesive bond of European society I also consider the balanced integration of citizens to be important but above all I believe that we need to foster dialogue between different cultures and worldviews Only in this way can we work together toward a common goal shaping our own visions while accepting the differences of others and respecting our diversity Only mutual understanding solidarity and a sense of belonging can give the citizens of Europe a sense of identity I support the efforts to shape a European citizenry based on common values history and culture P It is important to promote and celebrate the values and achievements of todays citizens while not allowing our memories of the past to sink into oblivion If we keep our common cultural heritage at the forefront we will strengthen the foundations of our shared future P In my view European citizenship means nothing other than taking responsibility for ourselves our country and the European Union and freely exercising our rights while respecting the same rights of others The right balance must also be struck between democratic rights and obligations P This is a common European citizenship of which I would be pleased to be part P Annex Commission statement P The Commission should like to draw the legislative authoritys attention to the need for the financial package mentioned in the basic act to be expressed at current prices and for this to be done no later than its final publication in the OJ This corresponds to the standard budgetary practice and will help to ensure with all due transparency that the legislative authoritys decision is complied with For the programme in question the sum at current prices amounts to EUR 215 million",

    "input": "1 Peace process in Spain vote We shall examine the motion for a resolution by the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group P The Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats has presented an amendment to paragraph 2 of its motion for a resolution P Parliament rejected the amendment by electronic vote P We shall now vote on the motion for a resolution presented P Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution by rollcall vote P Next we shall examine the motion for a resolution by the PSE ALDE GUENGL and VertsALE Groups IT Mr President in accordance with Rules 136 and 138 of the Rules of Procedure I would like to request an explanation regarding the fact that substantial amendments have been made outside of the terms laid down by the Rules of Procedure to the title and paragraph 6 of the resolution on which we are preparing to vote a resolution of great political importance In addition I would like to point out that versions of the new text are not yet available in all languages as laid down in the Rules of Procedure P Mr President we would like to know why the services have accepted such an amendment without I might add obtaining the agreement of the political groups and did not make use of an oral amendment as provided for by established practice and the Rules of Procedure P In accordance with the Rules of Procedure it is not possible to vote on an amendment to the text that was tabled outside of the permitted time and without having consulted the political groups The Secretariat informs me that a text is available for the honourable Members in all languages They assure me of that PL Mr President may I enquire if there has been some misunderstanding According to our voting lists the first vote was by show of hands The second vote on the resolution tabled by the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats was by roll call According to our lists however this vote should have been on the Socialists resolution and we voted against in the belief that it was the second vote Have I understood correctly that the vote that has taken place was the first vote I would like to point out that many of my Polish colleagues and also colleagues from the Czech Republic and other countries voted in the same way Could the situation be clarified please What the Presidency has put to the vote is very clear we have put an amendment to the motion for a resolution to the vote What we were voting on after that was very clear We were voting on the resolution presented by the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats and by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group One would have to be completely deaf not to understand what we were putting to the vote P Protests from the right P Applause from the left ES Mr President I would like to stress two procedural issues The first is that the amendment should have been voted on by a show of hands and not by rollcall vote P Applause from the Group P As we have just seen Mr President that error has led to confusion amongst some Members in terms of their voting intentions I would therefore ask you to put this error right in application of our Rules of Procedure P The second procedural issue is that the text of the Socialist resolution has been subject to a substantial amendment and I would stress substantial which has not conformed to the Rules of Procedure It should have been done by means of a registered amendment which was not done within the time limit laid down or by means of an oral amendment in plenary P The text of the Socialist resolution does not therefore conform to the Rules of Procedure Mr President and I would ask that you act accordingly P Applause from the right P Protests from the left Mr VidalQuadras we have not taken a rollcall vote but rather an electronic vote You have been here long enough to know the difference P Secondly interpreting the Rules of Procedure is not your responsibility but rather that of the President with the assistance of the Secretariat and I am listening to all of the arguments expressed so that I can take them properly into consideration and then act in the most appropriate manner possible but please do not pontificate Do not say this conforms to the Rules of Procedure and this does not because that is not your role P Protests of the right P Applause from the left DE Mr President I think you have said all that needs to be said The organisation of the agenda particularly in terms of the order and conduct of votes is the responsibility of the President My impression is that you conducted the votes perfectly properly However my political experience has also taught me one thing we are all politicians and that includes you ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats when no more progress can be made politically then the agenda has to take the blame We know that but I would ask Mr President that we vote now P Applause from the left Mr President given your esteemed background as a Spanish Socialist is it possible that you might have a conflict of interest in continuing in the Chair just on this point P Loud and sustained applause from the right ES Mr President given the confusion that certain speeches may have caused I simply wished to clarify that no Socialist resolution is going to be voted on but rather we are going to vote on a joint resolution by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe the Group of the GreensEFA and the GUENGL Group that is to say by several parliamentary groups jointly No Socialist resolution is going to be put to the vote Mr President P Applause from the right Mr President people may be trying to change the vote or whatever but I actually voted the wrong way because of the rollcall vote That is the proof of the matter There is at least one vote that was wrong there P Applause from the right PL Mr President it is surely essential for votes to reveal the wishes of this House that is to say the wishes of the Members of this Parliament Due to a mistake or an oversight a significant number of MEPs failed to vote according to their wishes I therefore make a formal request for the vote to be taken again There is no risk involved as the House will simply indicate what its true wishes are P Applause from the right Please we are dealing with a serious and important issue I would ask you to cooperate with the Bureau so that we can make a rational and appropriate analysis of what is happening There is no need to support each speech with approvals from one side or the other DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen regardless of ones opinion on this vote I have one comment and I would like the chairmen of the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats to respond to this what has been said here is a gross impertinence that the whole of Parliament should condemn This President was elected by a large majority and he has the right to lead every vote whether you like it or not Anything else is impertinent and obscene P Applause from the left ES Mr President I simply wished to refer to your reply to the VicePresident of Parliament Mr VidalQuadras to the effect that it falls to the President of the European Parliament to interpret the Rules of Procedure P Rule 1591 of Parliaments Rules of Procedure states that Parliament will normally vote by show of hands and Rule 1592 says that if the President decides that the result is doubtful a fresh vote shall be taken using the electronic voting system Mr President you proceeded to an electronic vote before any result was known and that has led to confusion P Mr President two months remain of your mandate in this Parliament Do not compromise your independence or prestige because neither you nor this Parliament deserve that P Mixed reactions I shall give the floor to Mr Poettering for a final speech on points of order there will be no more because this could go on forever I will then consult the Members of the Bureau so that I can take the appropriate decision in accordance with our Rules of Procedure DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen I believe that this morning in the difficult situation in which we find ourselves we had a debate that was very definitely worthy of this House Now is the time for all of us to take action and I would like to make it clear that the integrity of the President of this House is not being questioned P Applause P Having said that I would also ask that we now find a process that will enable us to come to a decision It would have been right if the first vote had been by show of hands since that is the normal way of going about it I then assumed you had called an immediate electronic vote on the grounds that you thought the results were so close together but the normal way of voting would have been by show of hands This voting process then had the regrettable result that some Members ended up voting a different way than they had intended P There is also the question as to whether the common text on which the groups agreed was put together properly and whether translations are available P Taken together all this adds up to a whole bundle of problems and so I would like to appeal to your goodwill in order that we may repeat the votes before moving on to vote on the groups joint motion for a resolution This House will then have spoken and its political will will then have been made manifest I ask you now to show the goodwill of which I have spoken P Applause Thank you very much Mr Poettering Thank you for coming out in defence of the honour of the President of the European Parliament P I believe that what Mrs Doyle has said is totally unacceptable and that it has nothing to do with what is happening here P Applause P We have more important things to discuss Ladies and gentlemen please allow me to take a few minutes to consult the members of the Bureau in relation to the three issues that have been raised during these speeches P The Presidency will then announce its decision and I would remind you that according to Rule 1664 of our Rules of Procedure the President will take the decision he considers appropriate immediately after the points of order that have been raised with regard to what is being discussed and that the Presidents decision will not be subject to any vote In other words whatever the President decides will be applied P Please allow me now to consult the members of the Bureau on the technical issues relating to the three problems raised P The sitting was suspended for a few moments P Ladies and gentlemen having consulted Parliaments services and having studied the aspects of our Rules of Procedure that relate to the issues that we have debated I believe that we should proceed as follows P with regard to the Resolution presented by a series of political groups the PSE ALDE GUENGL and VertsALE Groups I am told and I have no reason to doubt it that the text is available in all languages I am also told that there were lastminute amendments to the text yesterday that the Bureau accepted them without subjecting them to any formal amendment procedure because it did not believe that to be necessary The Resolution presented by the PSE ALDE GUENGL and VertsALE Groups is therefore ready to be voted on in the version subject to the latest amendment for the purposes of incorporating it into the debate We shall vote on it P secondly it is very reasonable to believe that there has been some confusion and that some Members have voted the second time without being aware of precisely what was being voted on despite the fact that I believe the Presidency had made it very clear I believe however that the objections have been raised with the best of intentions and that there have certainly been errors in the interpretation of what we were voting on Consequently and in order to truly reflect this Parliaments democratic will I shall repeat the two votes P Applause P Parliament rejected the amendment by show of hand verified electronically P The result of the second round is therefore the same as that of the first the amendment has been rejected P Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution by the PPEDE and UEN Groups by rollcall vote P The result is therefore exactly the same as the previous result but I imagine that everybody will feel reassured and that the will of the Members will have been better reflected P Parliament approved the motion for a resolution by the PSE ALDE GUENGL and VertsALE Groups by rollcall vote",

Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation EC No 16982005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development EAFRD C602372006 P the report by Mr Goepel on behalf of the Committee of Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down rules for voluntary modulation of direct payments provided for in Regulation EC No 17822003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulation EC 12902005 C602352006 Mr President according to the agenda we were supposed to be able to have and conclude a debate about both Mr Mulders report and my own this morning before having the opportunity to vote on them P We now have exactly 18 minutes until voting time It is completely unfair to our farmers and agriculturalists to begin a debate of this nature and then perhaps conclude such an important subject as the 20 voluntary modulation in other words a policy whereby onefifth of the existing direct payments to farmers are to be transferred or reduced with some form of contingency vote this afternoon P I request that this debate be postponed until November P Applause Are you asking for the debate or the vote to be postponed Mr President when are we to have this debate Surely not now in the 15 minutes that remain On behalf of my group and of my fellow MEPs I would like to bring forward a motion for the postponement of the debate I do realise that under the rules of procedure such a motion must be brought forward at least 24 hours before the debate but 24 hours before the debate I was unaware that Parliament would not be keeping to its agenda P Applause EL Mr President on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament we absolutely support the proposal by the rapporteur Mr Goepel for the debate and vote to be postponed until plenary in November DA Mr President I am deputising today for Mr Mulder who is unable to be with us for personal reasons and I would very much like on behalf of my group too to support Mr Goepels proposal At the same time I would like to direct some criticism at the Presidency It is absolutely outrageous that this extremely important issue which we needed to be able to deal with this week partly from the point of view of timing considerations should now be mishandled in this way and dealt with like this I therefore support Mr Goepels proposal to postpone both the debate and the vote Mr President I support Mrs Batzeli Mr Goepel and Mr Busk This is a very important debate it is about the whole future of the common agricultural policy It concerns all the countries in the European Union but none more than the United Kingdom As we have to catch planes this afternoon it is simply impossible to debate it now We really need to postpone the debate and the vote until November I hope you will accept that situation DE Mr President on behalf of my group too I would like to support the rapporteurs motion Looking at the report even the uninitiated would be able to tell that what we are dealing with here is rather a formal matter Behind this facade however as Mr Parish has already pointed out lies the fundamental consideration of the funding of agricultural policy in the coming years and the position of Parliament on this issue For this reason we must debate this issue at a proper time when there is sufficient time available so to do We cannot dismember this issue in this way P I therefore support this motion and ask that you agree to it and that you inform the Bureau of the significance of this dispute Perhaps the Bureau was not already aware of it PT Mr President I should just like to say that I agree with the proposal to postpone this debate and the vote until November for the reasons mentioned that is to say because it is too important an issue to be dealt with in a hurry in 15 minutes or a little more DE Mr President firstly I would ask that we simply vote on this motion so that you then also have the recommendation of this House Furthermore we could vote solely about postponement The decision as to when this subject is put on the agenda again is of course a matter for the Conference of Presidents and ultimately for the entire House Personally speaking however I would be in favour of postponing both Perhaps we could vote and then you would see the clear will of the House DE Mr President I would like to endorse the rapporteurs motion as well as what Mr Swoboda has said As rapporteur on financial planning I would also point out that this illstarred proposal is based on the conclusions of the European Council and that the Commission was obliged to come up with a proposal for this socalled voluntary modulation P In the course of the financial planning negotiations we explicitly reserved our position for the legislative process That is exactly what the rapporteur is now observing Given the significance of this matter I find it reasonable to ask the Council to be represented at the next debate after any postponement and to confirm to us that this will be the case PL On behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group I simply wanted to say that I also fully endorse Mr Goepels suggestion These are important reports and they deserve to be debated in a serious setting not under the present circumstances I fully support Mr Goepel I am convinced by the arguments I propose as President of this sitting that we change the agenda by withdrawing the joint debate on the reports by Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel P Parliament agreed to withdraw the two reports from that days agenda Mr President I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all the political parties and groups P Applause and laughter We have reached a reasonable solution The debate will take place at a more convenient time under more favourable conditions P The sitting was suspended at 1120 am and resumed at 1140 am",

    "input": "Oneminute speeches on matters of political importance The next item is the oneminute speeches on matters of political importance HU Mr President while we were gathered here on Monday for our last plenary session events were taking place in Budapest that merit the attention of all Europe That is the 50th anniversary of the 1956 uprising was being celebrated in Hungary That celebration however took quite an odd turn because the people were not allowed to participate One of the highranking guests present an Italian deputy prime minister said that these celebrations left the people out P Meanwhile the people on the street who wanted to celebrate peacefully were brutally attacked and beaten up The police caused serious injuries by shooting rubber bullets at head level and they pushed people off the streets Peaceable passersby who wanted to celebrate 1956 peacefully were not allowed to do so What a shame what a shame this was in the middle of Europe I call upon everyone who strives for human and civic liberties not to support this policy FR Mr President I would take the liberty of speaking once again on the subject of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor They are still in Tripoli in the prisons of the Libyan State P You know as I do that they are imprisoned under false accusations The review of their trial was supposed to conclude at the end of October However in October the court again postponed its decision this time until 19 December The court says that it is beginning to take into consideration the opinion of international experts who tirelessly bring evidence of the innocence of the accused P Mr President could we not demonstrate again the great interest that we take in the fate of these prisoners who have been tortured and have been absent from their homes for eight years for having treated young Libyans This situation cannot be tolerated as month after month they are promised a trial This new trial the third is inequitable and unjust and leaves them in the throes of a death sentence HU Mr President it is sad enough that the countries of Europe are witnessing ever more frequent acts of violence and destruction events that signal turmoil and inner tensions Stones being hurled cars set on fire elicit a forceful response from the police forces and these events show up on the newspaper headlines and television screens All this causes damage to Europe to the protesters to the forces of law and order in a word to democracy P It is even more detrimental however when certain politicians certain political parties feel justified in pronouncing judgment prior to the inquiry undertaken by the appointed independent judicial body The Hungarian socialist delegation read with profound shock the statement by the President of the European Peoples Party about the events surrounding the 50th anniversary What József Szájer said does not surprise us The grave allegations by the European Peoples Party made prior to the conclusion of the inquiry are to be qualified as prejudicial and as such on behalf of the Hungarian socialist delegation we reject them most emphatically LT Mr President ladies and gentlemen it has already been sixteen years since Lithuania regained its independence from the Soviet Union The same time has passed since Lithuania failed to get back its embassy building in Rome known as Villa Lituania which was owned by Lithuania until 1937 Today the Russian flag continues to fly on this building P After Russia occupied and annexed Lithuania in 1940 the then Lithuanian ambassador Stasys Lozoraitis presented a note to the Italian Government emphasising the illegitimate nature of the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union and the fact that Lithuanian diplomatic missions in foreign countries should not change their status Despite this Soviet officials occupied Villa Lituania in the presence of the representatives of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the police P After the restoration of Lithuanias independence Italy avoided any responsibility and suggested negotiating with Russia concerning the building Even though the Italian Government appears to have changed its position now this matter remains unresolved Why would the Italian Government make no attempt to reconsider its past history EL Mr President ladies and gentlemen despite the reassuring messages and replies from the Central European Bank and the Commission on the cases of forgery of the euro this phenomenon continues to preoccupy the administrative authorities and Europol P Just last week we had two particularly worrying cases The first concerns the gang of Colombian counterfeiters brought down A total of EUR 6 million was seized in forged 50 and 100 euro notes destined for Spain and other countries of the European Union P The same week in Germany hundreds of thousands of 5 and 20 euro notes were dissolved in water with the result that the German authorities were questioned as to the causes while the citizens of this country hanker after the strong and independent Deutschmark P What is going on with the euro How secure are citizens when they themselves are at risk even though victims of being referred for investigation as we have seen in several countries on suspicion of counterfeiting or moving forged notes P How long will the Central European Bank turn a blind eye Or is it only interested in when interest rates will rise again and start throttling consumers Mr President I rise to ask you and others in this House to use their best offices to intervene in the case of ten Iranian Ahwazi Arab rights activists who according to the Iranian media face the death penalty this week P The men stand accused of bombing oil installations but the evidence is unconvincing All ten men made confessions under torture According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch none of them had a fair trial Their lawyers were not allowed to see them before their trial and were only briefed on the prosecution case a few hours before the start of court proceedings which were held in secret The lawyers for the condemned men have themselves been arrested for complaining about the illegal and unjust nature of these trials and have been charged with threatening national security P I therefore hope that many Members will make contact with the Iranian authorities to make clear their views on these tragic cases PL Mr President one week has passed since the introduction of new baggage restrictions on airline passengers However I am still constantly asked what the matter is if just days after Great Britain has eased these restrictions they have been implemented Europewide I still have not received an explanation for this situation even though I am a representative of the Committee for Transport and Tourism P Another issue is the lack of clarity over the new regulations which are totally confusing to passengers It appears that they have a different interpretation in just about every airport At Wrocław Airport for example which is the one I use I was told to throw away a stick deodorant even though it was not in liquid form as a penalty for not having declared it P In such a simple matter would it not be possible to harmonise these rules so that they are interpreted in a uniform way and that it is not up to the goodwill or otherwise of individual officials I hope to receive a reply to these questions HU Mr President in 198990 Hungary created the foundations for democracy and the rule of law without any violence Now 16 years later the spirit of coercion has nevertheless been unleashed because the current government unfortunately saw fit to use intimidation in order to attain its goals thereby suppressing democratic opposition The use of force is to be condemned let there be no mistake Rioting by violent groups is unacceptable but even in problematic situations respect for the tools of the rule of law is indispensable P Defenders of Hungarian democracy must seize every legal means to ensure that the violent events of 23 October will never be repeated when the police violently broke up the crowds and failed to observe the most basic demands of human rights precisely when people were commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Revolution We Hungarians believe in democratic freedom which we have struggled so hard to achieve and wish to make use of our human rights Mr President I would like to raise the issue of incitement to racial and religious hatred in Europe P Over the past two weeks in the United Kingdom we have had two trials One concerned a young Muslim who during a demonstration regarding I believe the infamous Danish cartoons called for the beheading of those who insult Islam He was rightly convicted and imprisoned Yet in contrast Nick Griffin the leader of Britains neofascist British National Party who was caught by the BBC declaring Islam a vile and wicked religion was found not guilty of the same I would ask that the relevant Commissioner considers whether or not at European level we need new and stronger legislation in this area This is not an issue of freedom of speech but freedom from fear Comments like those of the BNP leader put the Muslim and minority communities at risk The evidence is that when BNP councillors are elected racist violence in the relevant area doubles or triples leading to problems for the whole area Mr President I rise to ask for your support for efforts at EU level to counter discrimination in the workplace and in particular for the EUfunded Work It Out Programme which is a project that produces tools to help people with intellectual disabilities those who support them and European legal experts in this area This programme provides information on the framework Employment Directive which seeks to combat discrimination and unequal treatment at work That directive has recently been transposed by Member States and provides vital protection to people with intellectual disabilities who face discrimination at work P Mr President I would ask you to ensure that the definition of worker in this directive includes people in sheltered employment We must be watchful and ensure that the directive is being implemented correctly in each Member State Intellectual disability covers a large range of people with very different capabilities some people with intellectual disabilities work and live independently in the community while others have complex or profound needs and require constant support However it is important not to make assumptions about what intellectual disability means since with appropriate support and preparation many people with intellectual disabilities can be a valuable part of the workforce P Mr President I would ask that you devote personal attention to this matter ES Mr President to begin with I should like to thank you in your own language for what you said to President Putin that we will not trade human rights for energy P PL I would also like to see the ban imposed by Russia on the import of meat from Poland discussed at this meeting Russias accusations are groundless and the matter has become too long and drawnout I believe that it is not just a matter between Poland and Russia but between Russia and the entire European Union I would like this house to put some pressure on the European Commission to take steps to resolve this abnormal situation FR Mr President an unprecedented power cut hit Western Europe on the night of 45 November It revealed the fragility of the European energy system and the inadequate capacity for producing and transporting electricity the result of a poor investment policy P Despite the risk of blackouts for the last six years European operators have been reducing the level of their investments which has fallen from 16 to 10 of their turnover At the same time electricity consumption has continued to rise by 18 per year This fall in investments is the direct consequence of liberalising the energy market Rather than investing in the development of new production capacity operators are concentrating their efforts on profits and on buying out their competitors P On the one hand the public has seen electricity prices soar while on the other hand security has decreased Only a European energy policy could guarantee successful cooperation between Member States and the implementation of necessary investments to the tune of EUR 700 billion between now and 2030 P Electricity is a public good this should be reflected in the European Unions political initiatives PL Mr President despite numerous interventions discussions and measures by Poland to comply with Russias conditions Russia continues to maintain its embargo on Polish foodstuffs including meat Poland has not and will not be able to resolve this situation until the European Union applies equal market protection rules for all Member States P It is intolerable that Poland should be facing problems selling its products both on the external market and on the internal European market due to the impact of goods from third countries being dumped on its market Poland like the other Member States cannot deal with Russia on her own The partner that Russia should be dealing with is the European Union as a whole P For this reason I am raising the fundamental question of whether at the European UnionRussia summit planned for 24 November this year Polands problems will be treated as problems which affect the European Union as a whole This is certainly an important issue I cannot give you an answer because as you know we have not been invited to take part in this summit but I am sure that both the Commission and the Council will bear Polands problems in mind when dealing with EURussian relations PL Mr President I would also like to raise the matter of the European Commissions hand luggage regulations I do not know whether the President and the Commission are aware of the fact that the food and cosmetics industry is unable to keep up with these regulations and the majority of cosmetics do not come in 100 ml packaging This means that shampoos lotions and other cosmetics in liquid form have to be poured down the sink and the remainder poured into 100 ml containers because 200 ml containers are not allowed on board the aircraft P Of course you can have your baggage checked in although 5 million pieces of baggage go missing each year worldwide Often total chaos and confusion prevails at airports and the officials responsible are unable to cope P So it appears that the terrorists are one step ahead of us again and have got us in a corner The way things are going it will not be long before they have us all flying in straitjackets and disposable hospital slippers PL Mr President JEREMY a joint and extremely valuable initiative of DG REGI and the European Investment Bank for 2007 2013 is currently being negotiated with individual Member States The aim of the initiative is to facilitate access to European Regional Development Fund cash for small and mediumsized enterprises P The aim of JEREMY is to help regional business startups and development through all kinds of nongrant based instruments such as microcredits or guarantees Unfortunately there is resistance on the part of some Member States for the decision depends on them to reallocating part of their structural funds towards this new initiative Some refuse outright to include them in their programmes even though it is clear that they will be unable to utilise all of their funds and will have problems with uptake P This means running the risk that JEREMY a superb instrument capable of supporting business initiative in the regions will remain unused We as the European Parliament have the obligation to encourage Member States to make use of the opportunities offered by JEREMY because in addition to major investments from the structural funds it is the development of small business and the generation of business activity that are the powerhouse of regional development and therefore they deserve particular support DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen this year and for the tenth time the Europa Centre in Graz organised a European youth meeting with participants drawn from all over Europe devoted to the theme of European future objectives and with the participants giving their attention to the future development of the European Union Following an information session on the European Union and its institutions the participants over sixty of them moved to a roleplay exercise in which they imagined themselves as representatives of these institutions and worked through a large number of items producing a twentypoint resolution to the effect that inter alia the powers of the Union should be extended that the budget should be topped up and that there should be no further enlargement before the treaty on a constitution for Europe has entered into force Young people are Europes future and we should be very strong advocates for their education and further education for that too is where our future lies EL Mr President one of the achievements of democracy is university asylum which of course does not develop in the same way in every country In Greece suddenly university asylum means the anarchists the pockets of terrorism which we pursue hotly in this Chamber are creating cells and using universities as sites to manufacture Molotov cocktails and attack shops and neighbours P It is a terrible problem faced by my country which is unable to find a solution It is unable to take them on and that is where the main problem lies Can we legislate uniformly in all the countries of Europe for equal respect for asylum because this situation is spiralling out of control and not just in Greece In other capitals of countries of Europe we have the same problem the anarchists in asylum are a state within a state There should be respect for asylum but this should not become cells pockets of anarchy of all those going around in hoods violating extorting and plundering the life of the citizens Let us at long last legislate for the good of universities for the good of students and not for the good of the extremists or certain extremists fighting against the state HU Mr President it might become one of the signs of discrimination against the new Member States if administrative costs for 2007 were to be reduced at their expense Paring down bureaucracy is a worthy aim but it puts at risk the filling of eight hundred positions for the new Member States These civil servants ought already to have been hired in the first half of 2006 I call upon the Commission to fulfil its obligations and to continue hiring new civil servants at the agreed pace P I hope that the European Commission will not listen to the Fidesz party I would not wish to see the new Member States suffer from the smear campaign that party has launched claiming that the new Member States do not deserve to be treated as equals because they are run by postcommunists who trample human rights underfoot Whatever Kinga Gál and József Szájer may say in this Chamber to my mind it is the interview given today by Elmar Brok chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs which holds true Hungarian democracy and the rule of law are not in danger HU Mr President a few days ago as a result of an energy network breakdown millions of Europeans were left without power if only for an hour This blackout unprecedented since the 1970s has once again shed light on the fact that it is increasingly difficult to bring energy regulation which is largely within national jurisdictions into line with the demands of energy security in the 21st century P At the same time the dangers with regard to gas supply are becoming increasingly evident The conflict over gas prices that has been developing in recent weeks between Russia and Georgia makes it clear that Russia is prepared in a completely overt fashion to use its energy resources for political purposes This is the reason one that is all the more frightening for the EU why Russia which plays a key role in our gas supply does not wish to sign the European Energy Charter P Having thus experienced our dependency on two occasions in recent days our response can only be a common EU energy policy based on solidarity that speaks with one voice at the international level The Energy Green Paper currently being debated in Parliament should serve as a suitable starting point for formulating such a policy Mr President a study carried out by the highly renowned Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical School in the USA in collaboration with the Baghdad Medical School published last month in the internationally prestigious medical journal The Lancet showed that approximately 655 000 civilians have died as a result of the violent hostilities in Iraq between March 2003 and July 2006 Of these many thousands have been children whose deaths were deemed by vicious criminal terrorists in Iraq and seemingly heartless politicians in Washington and London to be acceptable collateral damage P Mr Bushs and Mr Blairs invasion and occupation of Iraq has turned into a bloodbath of innocent people worse than during satanic Saddams rule of terror We can no longer look on passively I call upon you to recommend to the Conference of Presidents an urgent debate on the carnage involving civilians in Iraq in the hope that we might help convert the madness of war into the logic of peace Kyoto was and is a blueprint for sane and sensible environmental policies by way of the reduction of damaging greenhouse gas emissions Unfortunately the reasonable targets set and agreed by Member States have been and continue to be ignored in many cases P In the case of Ireland for example we have a tradition of signing up to international agreements and protocols and then walking away from them The big offender however is the United States of America I welcome the results of the United States congressional elections The fact that the American people have turned their backs on George Bush because of Iraq may also be an indication that his stubborn refusal to embrace Kyoto is not shared by the vast majority of the American population Could it be that the tornadoes and the hurricanes and the natural disasters in the United States caused by global warming are a result of the reckless dependence on and usage of fossil fuels As a former British chief economist with the World Bank Dr Nicholas Stern put it very succinctly good environmental practice does not simply make environmental sense it also makes good economic sense Mr President last week a group of Irish MEPs met in Brussels with a group of mercy sisters who are working very closely with poor and marginalised members of the asylum and refugee communities The stories we heard from those religious sisters were very alarming especially as they came from a country that says it is civilised and treats people properly though I dare say Ireland is not the only country not to treat refugee and asylum seekers correctly and humanely P We intend as a group to pursue this issue within Ireland It would appear that the Dublin II Regulation evaluation of which we currently await is not working Very often we hear from people working in this area that the theory and the practice do not match We need to do something about that Of particular concern however is the phenomenon of children lost to the system Such children are in Ireland but nobody knows where exactly or who can account for them That is an appalling prospect in a Member State of the European Union P We need to look very carefully at how we treat the poor and marginalised in our Community We need an independent evaluation of the process and a longterm solution to the issue of why those people should need our support EL Mr President I think that developments in universities in connection with the basic issue of education are a cause for concern for millions of workers and students in the Member States We therefore need to be extremely careful when we refer to university asylum which is a fundamental achievement of the student movement in our country P The student uprising at the Polytechnic is thirtythree years on a shining example of the right of the peoples for democracy within universities and of the need for radical changes to be made at this level These opinions being voiced in the European Parliament on restricting these basic democratic freedoms are dangerous PL Mr President I am shocked by the latest session of the diplomatic heads of the Member States where the majority of foreign ministers asked for a European Union mandate to negotiate a new agreement between the EU and Russia before Russia lifts the trade restrictions it is imposing on Poland in the form of an embargo on Polish meat and agricultural produce In other words instead of European solidarity what we have is an agreement with Moscow made over Polands head leaving my country to fend for itself HoweverWarsaw is rightly demanding that the negotiating mandate include a ban on trade barriers in relations between Russia and individual EU Member states Instead of a few words of support from Commissioner FerreroWaldner relations between the European Union and Russia should be based on the slogan of the Three Musketeers one for all and all for one Failure to do this would make European solidarity nothing more than a meaningless phrase and I say this forcefully in the country of the Three Musketeers ES Mr President last week Volkswagen unfortunately announced job cuts at its European factories which may affect the plants at Pamplona in Spain Brussels in Belgium and Palmela in Portugal P In Germany too 20 000 of the 100 000 workers at the plant may be laid off That will mean the loss of one in five workers and 2 400 jobs may go at the other plants P If we add to that the problems that we have had with Opel and General Motors in Portugal it is quite clear that we are facing a very serious problem an industrial crisis that demands a response In my view we can no longer put off establishing a framework agreement with the entire European car industry and a code of conduct with the multinational companies basically so as to guarantee jobs P I think the time has come for the Commission and Europes institutions to take a very strong stand on this EL Mr President the former leader of Iraq Saddam Hussein has been sentenced to death by hanging for crimes against humanity because he was found guilty of the death of 148 Shiites following an assassination attempt against him in 1982 P I believe that as repulsive as the crime is the death penalty is not a solution and is not in keeping with the European acquis However I noted with regret that the British Foreign Secretary Margaret Becket expressed her satisfaction with this verdict and stated that those accused of crimes against the Iraqis should be brought to justice I therefore ask you as the death penalty has been abolished in all the countries of the European Union because it is an insult to human dignity and simply encourages violence while doing absolutely nothing to prevent crime how can a Member State of the Union welcome such a verdict How can the death penalty uphold the justice cited by Mrs Becket PL Mr President the 16th October saw yet another German violation of Polands territorial sovereignty On that day a German vessel was bound for the Polish port of Świnoujście On entering Polish territorial waters she was boarded by Polish customs officials who discovered contraband alcohol When the vessel was a few metres from shore she suddenly turned about and headed for the German side Despite orders from the harbourmaster for the vessel to remain in port and despite being pursued and ordered to stop by two pursuit vessels of the Polish Border Guard the Germen vessel left Polish waters with the Polish customs officials aboard They were then arrested in Germany on charges of unlawful activity The whole affair is an outrage P I would also like to point out that in August the German Navy conducted manoeuvres in Polish waters without informing the Polish authorities and causing problems to passenger ferries trying to get to Polish ports P This is the latest German provocation which ignores the PolishGerman border It is in breach of international law and jeopardises internal relations within the European Union I call upon German politicians to come to their senses and finally acknowledge their countrys borders with their neighbours PL Mr President we as MEPs have been receiving correspondence from individuals and organisations about the problem of the savage treatment of stray dogs in Romania P The reason I draw attention to this is that in the European Union we have adopted certain standards recently when debating an action plan for animal protection we accepted the principle that the protection and humane treatment of animals is a challenge for European culture and civilisation in the 21st century P Romania is about to join the European Union in a few weeks time and we cannot accept standards that are at odds with European standards It is an issue I would like to draw your attention to and I ask the European Commission also to address this issue and to intervene appropriately EL Mr President I should like to draw the Members attention to the abuse of and negative references made to periods of history especially the Middle Ages We often hear talk of mediaeval employment which is apparently being imposed in the resolution on the directive on services or with the promotion of the revised directive on working times P The Middle Ages were a long period in history during which the foundations were laid in Europe of its present form and work was carried out to combine the GrecoRoman civilisation with Christianity Of course during the Middle Ages employment relations were typified by an uninterrupted connection with the master the employer and the place of work and were organised in the form of professional guilds which were impenetrable regimes which safeguarded monopolies Today liberal united Europe on the contrary has safeguarded free movement and mobility and is proceeding to liberalise services and abolish the practices which plagued the inhabitants of Europe during various periods in history such as the Middle Ages That concludes this item",

    "input": "2006 annual report on the Euro Area debate The next item is the report by José Manuel GarcíaMargallo y Marfil on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the 2006 annual report on the euro area 20062239 INI rapporteur ES Mr President this is the first time that Parliament has debated a report on the economic situation in the euro zone and I therefore regard this report as being of unique importance particularly as this debate this analysis that we are conducting jointly for the first time is taking place at a time when the situation is both politically complex and economically uncertain P I say it is politically complex because as we are dealing with institutional issues here I cannot ignore the fact that the debate on what to do with the Constitutional Treaty is still ongoing Another point that I cannot ignore either is that this report is being debated within a new era in terms of monetary policy with interest rates that have been rising for some time and threaten to keep on rising and at a stage when we are embarking on the new Stability and Growth Pact as revised by the Commission and when the Member States are for the first time coming before the European institutions to account for what they have done regarding the Lisbon Strategy in their national reform plans P I say that the situation is economically confused because while I agree with the Commissions view that the economic situation is good or at least much better than it was previously I must emphasise that our potential 2 growth is not enough to absorb Europes unemployed to keep pace with our competitors or to maintain our standard of living P As is customary in this House this report is divided into several sections macroeconomic policy reforms with special emphasis on the internal market and institutional issues focusing on economic policy coordination and external representation P In the area of macroeconomic policy there is nothing really new other than what we said in the debate on the broad economic guidelines What the doctor prescribes for our macroeconomic policy is more stability more stability and more stability P On monetary policy the point that we highlight and I repeat that we are highlighting institutional issues is that we would like to see greater transparency and openness in the European Central Bank We would like to know why it does what it does and how it manages and takes into account the two pillars on which it bases its decisions That is why we are asking for short minutes to be published showing the arguments for and against a particular decision P On the subject of budgetary policy this reports first finding is that monetary policy may be losing the momentum that it has shown so far and budgetary policy must take up the torch That as I have highlighted before leads us to call on the Commission to adhere to a strict interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact and on the Member States to work harder at cutting their deficits especially in good times Something new that we are calling for is greater coordination of Member States fiscal calendars and of the economic forecasts that they use in making their budgetary projections P It does not make sense for countries taking part in the European Economic Union to use different forecasts of oil prices or of interest or exchange rate trends in our dialogue with the national parliaments we should like everyone to know what we are talking about P On the matter of public debt we also call on the Member States as usual to make a greater effort to cut public debt in order to free up resources and to address the Lisbon Strategy and the budgetary challenges that will result from the ageing of our population The last point which has been repeated already is to review our fiscal systems in order to enhance the competitiveness of Europes economy P With regard to reforms we prescribe Lisbon and more Lisbon We want the public to see how well each Member State is performing We therefore call for a code of conduct that will enable us to put greater pressure on the slowest countries and through the dissemination of good practice enable them to see how countries at the top of the class operate P Regarding the internal market we need freedom and more freedom in contrast to the protectionist temptations that we have seen in recent years as well as development of the services market In short we want consolidation of fundamental freedoms P As regards institutional issues I want to focus on improving the way the Union operates we call for a trialogue between the Council the Commission and Parliament to take place quarterly in parallel with the dialogue that we have with the European Central Bank although I am aware that the Commissioner is not enamoured with the idea P To facilitate this trialogue we ask that the Eurogroup draw up a roadmap showing which way the euro zone will be heading in the next two years We call on the Commission to provide us in subsequent reports with a more specific toolbox in order to promote such talks and we invite the Commissioner and the Council to meet with us every three months P On the matter of external representation we find that it is not consistent with the international weight of the euro We are pleased that the Member States spoke with one voice at the meetings of the international institutions in Singapore and we call for greater coordination and imagination to ensure that the Member States are represented as a single entity in the International Monetary Fund the World Bank and other international bodies P I am grateful to all the shadow rapporteurs and all my fellow Members for the efforts that they have made Member of the Commission ES Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would first like to thank Mr GarcíaMargallo and the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the interest that it has shown in analysing this first Commission Annual Report on the Euro Area whose main objective is to promote dialogue and debate between our two institutions with a view to identifying the priority measures that will improve the way that the whole area operates P Since I had the opportunity to present this report to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in July the predictions for growth in the euro zone for this year and the following two years have significantly improved Last week I presented our autumn predictions which can be summarised by saying that all of the economic indicators are pointing in the right direction rising economic growth which is the highest in the euro zone since the start of the decade falling unemployment stable inflation and clear reduction in public deficits P The factors that have contributed to this positive picture include external factors such as the sustained strength of the global economy but also internal factors which contradict the image of stagnation and paralysis that has been used to portray European economies and in particular the economy of the euro zone Among these internal factors are the reforms in several countries in the euro zone in recent years the budgetary consolidation efforts and the response of European economies to the significant increase in oil prices which is more efficient than many expected P The existence of the euro zone has also significantly contributed to this favourable climate thanks to the good finance conditions for families and businesses provided by the current level of interest rates and also thanks to the protection the euro has provided against the turbulence of the financial markets as occurred in the spring P However all of these positive factors do not invalidate the main conclusions of the Commission report on measures that should enable us to improve the operation of the area which the majority of you agree with according to Mr GarcíaMargallos report P I am talking about the need to go further with structural reforms to consolidate the single market and to ensure more effective and integrated external representation of the euro zone than there has been so far P These three priorities which are set out in the report will also be included in the Annual Economic Report that I will present to the Commission on 22 November which this year focuses on the operation of Economic and Monetary Union and in particular of the euro zone in the light of the eight years of experience that have been accumulated P Having examined these three priorities and in relation to economic reforms I agree with the statement made in the report regarding the importance of carrying out the reforms promised by the Member States in the national reform plans as part of the Lisbon Strategy P Once monetary policy has been unified and budgetary policy has been made part of the Stability and Growth Pact the economic policies of each of the national governments should make the necessary adjustments in terms of productivity competitiveness and the operation of markets in order to ensure a high degree of convergence within the area P In December based on the reports submitted by the Member States the Commission will adopt the report on the first year of application of the national reform plans Our report will include an explicit evaluation of the degree to which each of the Member States has put these reforms into practice and if we consider it to be necessary we will give recommendations for each of the countries P We will also include an evaluation in the report of what we the European institutions have done in application of the reforms required for the Lisbon Community programme P We agree as I said before on the need to go further with the internal market which along with the single currency is one of the two essential instruments for promoting more efficient allocation of resources and offering greater opportunities to businesses and more choice to consumers P The integration of the financial system is also a top priority for the proper functioning of Economic and Monetary Union In this sector the roadmap is set out in the Commission White Paper on financial services covering the 20052010 period P With regard to external representation of the euro zone I can confirm that the European Parliament agrees on the need for coherent external representation As I had the opportunity to explain in one of my recent speeches to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs the European Union spoke with once voice in Singapore as Mr GarcíaMargallo has just reiterated In October after this meeting both in the Eurogroup and in Ecofin we debated this matter again and arrived at some additional agreements that are moving in the right direction P Mr GarcíaMargallos report also contains comments on monetary policy and on the application of the Treaty criteria for expanding the euro zone The European Central Bank is one of the most transparent central banks in the world and this perception is highly valued by the markets which appreciate the Banks communication policy P With regard to the application of the inflation criteria for the enlargement of the euro zone which we have debated many times in this House recently I refer to what has been said so far P Finally I do not know what doubts Mr GarcíaMargallo has perceived I am entirely in favour of dialogue with this House on the operation of the euro zone The Chair of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is well aware of this as just a few days ago I had the opportunity to discuss with her how we can put it into practice on behalf of the PPEDE Group DE Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats welcomes this report not only is there no dispute about that but we also say yes to its demands its analysis and its substance P By way of elaboration I would like to say something about six fundamentals The first is that the euro is the EUs most potent response to globalisation P The second is that it may be the most important instrument for a successful internal market but it is not the only one it must go handinhand with the accelerated implementation of the four freedoms in the internal market by means of proactive innovation the removal of structural weaknesses and the stabilisation of the social security pensions and health systems P Thirdly all EU Member States need to join the euro zone Any EU Member State that resists the euro and sets itself in opposition to the euro zone that fails to make every effort to become part of the European currency area weakens the internal market and lessens the European Unions resistance to the effects of globalisation P Fourthly the Maastricht criteria are the entry ticket and I am glad that the Commission in its decisions over recent months has held fast to them P Fifthly the Stability and Growth Pact is the necessary framework for budget policy We demand that cyclical increases in revenue be used to reduce deficits and states debts P Sixthly according to todays newspapers the French interior minister Mr Sarkozy is calling for the euro zone to be under European economic government Those who want to strengthen the European economy need to ratify the constitution and endow the Commission with the necessary powers that is why we favour a strong euro on world markets and a single voice in the IMF along with a European foreign minister to enable the European Union to carry some global clout Mr President Commissioner I welcome the opportunity presented to us by this debate in plenary to review together the operation of the euro zone at a time when as you have said the outlook in certain areas is improving yet when all agree that the potential for growth is not fully realised and when our economies are handicapped by an exchange rate that makes euro zone exports difficult and leads some of our businesses to contemplate relocation in order to produce their goods in the dollar zone P This report presents an opportunity for review at a time when the Stability Pact has been revised and all agree that the commitments made by the Member States of the euro zone perhaps need to be better differentiated from the commitments made outside of the zone From this point of view the report is valuable and I believe that we must also congratulate our fellow Member Mr GarcíaMargallo on the spirit in which he approached it P We need to go further than reforming the Stability Pact in order to better coordinate timeframes and data and to ensure that essentially the Commission and the Central Bank do not evaluate the performances of the Member States of the euro zone solely from the point of view of their deficits but also in the light of their strengths and weaknesses in a wider context You mentioned this in your speech Commissioner and I am grateful for your having done so I invite you moreover to continue along these lines P There is also a need to link macroeconomic analysis more closely with developments on the financial markets Furthermore the way in which rating agencies have been able to be involved in the Italian question and to assess that countrys debt must prompt us to be more vigilant since if rating agencies had to take a highlevel role in the assessment of the debts of the Member States there would be a very serious risk with regard to the leadership of the euro zone P One final word Commissioner to reinforce what has been said by several others on the subject of exchange rates we need more economic policies and economic leadership in this area on behalf of the ALDE Group LT Mr President ladies and gentlemen the Economic and Monetary Union with a common currency is the highest level of economic integration the European Union has thus far reached The euro zone has already been operating for six years and its first enlargement revealed that the Maastricht criteria established more than a decade ago no longer correspond to the reality of the enlarging EU and the developing global economy The euro zone countries are unable to implement the indicators that are important for the operation of the euro zone especially the requirement for price stability P The European Commission according to the EC Treaty and the European Central Bank are both applying different criteria of price stability to the euro zone According to the European Central Bank price stability ensures lower inflation which is still close to 2 Based on the methods of the European Commission the stability of prices in the euro zone is established by considering more than just the rate of inflation of the euro zone countries and therefore it is impossible to eliminate uncharacteristic inflation factors P I call on the Commission and the European Central Bank to work together on improvement of the concept of euro zone price stability and methods for its establishment in order to avoid misapprehensions in the process of euro zone enlargement and implementation of indicators in the euro zone itself I invite euro zone Member States to properly implement the euro zone membership criteria that were adopted by the Member States themselves for better economic integration Furthermore I would like to emphasise that structural reforms are necessary for the successful competition of both the European Union and the euro zone in the global economy and especially in further implementation of a domestic market with free movement of services which has contributed to the competitiveness of the European Union on behalf of the GUENGL Group SV Mr President Commission fellow Members ladies and gentlemen I wish to begin by thanking Mr GarcíaMargallo y Marfil for this report on the situation in the euro zone The rapporteur observes that the prognoses for the euro zone look better than they have done for a long time That depends of course on what economic policy it is intended to conduct The policy pursued so far has not exactly been a success Large parts of Europe are in social and economic crisis According to the latest statistics seven million people are living in poverty in Europes largest economy Germany One of the causes of this is specifically economic and monetary union EMU is presided over by the worlds most conservative central bank when it comes to inflation and its Stability Pact stymies economic policy As the European Trade Union Confederation ETUC recently observed in a report it is not more of this inflexible policy that we need Instead the peoples of Europe need an active financial policy and a reorganisation of EMU P As you know my own country Sweden is not a member of EMU In 2003 a clear majority voted against participating in it That is why I am rather disturbed to read the report which notes that as from 2007 the euro zone will comprise 13 Member States but that and I quote macroeconomic policy coordination and the internal market will involve all 27 Member States What does that mean Does it mean that Sweden which has voted against EMU will have to participate in it sooner or later I should be grateful for an answer from the Commission and also from the rapporteur if he is given the floor at the end of the debate on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President in our discussion of the 2006 annual report on the situation in the euro zone there are two points I would like to make The first is the much lower economic growth rate and higher unemployment in the countries of the European Union and in the euro zone in particular than in the USA and in the emerging markets such as China and India Economic growth in the euro zone will in 20052007 be almost half of that of the USA while unemployment will be almost twice as high P The second point is the higher economic growth rate and the lower unemployment rates in three of the fifteen countries which did not join the euro zone compared with countries inside the zone No wonder that those countries are not rushing to join the single currency The new Member States now have even greater reservations about joining the euro zone even though they are continuing to work hard to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria on behalf of the INDDEM Group PL Mr President growth in the euro zone has been the lowest in the world for many years as it was in 2006 as well But instead of looking for the causes at home in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank attempts are being made to impose the socalled harmonisation of budgetary and tax policies in the Member States P This is an attempt to hobble the initiative of Member States a kind of diktat imposed by the stronger on the weaker If the point of creating a common currency was firstly to simplify the system and thereby to reduce costs secondly to attract foreign investment and thirdly to make use of the privilege of issuing currency and creating a new world currency then in the latter two cases the desired effect has not been achieved P Foreign investment continues to focus on the United States and Asia Demand for the euro as a world currency is comparatively weak The opposite effect has been achieved keeping interest rates high and artificially bolstering the euro has undermined the competitiveness of European manufacturers and reduced export earnings The common currency and the policy of the ECB appear to be serving the interests of finance capital at the cost of businessmen consumers and the Member States national budgets P The single currency has had an indirect impact on the exports of the new Member States by slowing their development and holding them back We therefore take the view that there needs to be a radical review of EU monetary doctrine towards restoring authority over currency issue and interest rates to the monetary authorities of the Member States DE Mr President we can all in fact take pride in the euro Much of what was predicted before its introduction has not come to pass but there are three things that need constant emphasis One is that the tax revenues that are now coming in must actually be used to reduce deficits and we demand this in paragraph 5 of the report Another is the urgent demand that the Maastricht criteria be rigorously applied Relaxing them again in the way they have been in the past will surely get us nowhere Thirdly there is transparency The ECB lags a long way behind global standards The ongoing failure to produce anything like adequate minutes of decisions or indeed any at all defies comprehension and this state of affairs is in urgent need of improvement Mr President firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report It underlines the need for cooperation in strengthening the European economy It is fair to say that the euro has provided Europe with stability that we have never seen before P When I listened earlier to my Swedish colleague it sounded as though it was a problem for the European economy to have low interest rates However the truth is that we have lower interest rates than ever before Does anyone think that the European economy would have been better if we had the interest rates of the 1970s or 1980s or if we had the budget deficits of those years when Europe was losing out in the European economy Let us stop dreaming and look at the reality Today we have a common currency that places the emphasis on and encourages competition trade and investment and focuses on the need for structural reforms as well as the need for fiscal discipline That is good That provides us with opportunities because the problem of the European economy is not the interest rates it is the lack of deregulation it is the lack of more trade and of more of the internal market We can see that we are more efficient and more successful since we opened up the markets P I believe that the euro will never be stronger than the European economy and the discipline of the countries participating in the euro That also underlines the need for the European Central Bank to be independent as underlined in the report That is very important because otherwise we will lose credibility P From a Swedish perspective we will soon have the euro in a number of new countries around the Baltic Sea I hope we will have a debate in my country that will make it possible for us to join them and other euro countries in the years to come DE Mr President I am glad that the Commission has produced this report and that it is committed to observing what happens to the euro zone but equally glad to be able to say that Mr Junckers presence here today means that there will be a contribution to our debate from the person who has the responsibility of speaking on behalf of the euro zones members P So then where do we stand For the first time we have got closer to the growth target that we set ourselves in Lisbon growth in the euro zone now stands at 28 which is almost the 3 that we took as a base figure at Lisbon P In this situation what is the challenge for the euro zone What is the essential thing that is at stake Will we be content with this being nothing more than a little gust of air no more than an upturn in the cycle that will be gone by tomorrow or do we want to put something structural in place to ensure that we can draw a deep breath and get the chance to generate a longterm upturn that will last and will since it is not merely data that make the economy but people foster popular confidence P That is why I believe that we have to make the effort to do what is now needed namely to make smart investments in the euro zone Yes consolidating budgets is a good thing to do but we cannot simply chant that as a mantra when what we need to be doing is making use of the upturn we are experiencing now in order to embark on a policy of intelligent modernisation that gives us a chance of seriously reducing unemployment and that too is in the report P Finally I would like to thank our corapporteur and shadow rapporteur Mr Rosati who contributed to our discussions on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and I do not want to omit Mr GarcíaMargallo y Marfil to whom thanks are due for having and not for the first time made an essential and seminal contribution to macroeconomic debate in this House Mr President events seem to have overtaken this report In spite of Commissioner Almunias comments its upbeat projections for growth in the euro zone contrast sharply with the economic data released at the end of last week which put growth in the French economy at zero There are also signs of faltering growth across the euro zone which will not be helped by the austere taxation regimes being introduced in Germany and Italy next year to meet the euro zones stability requirements P What this report does not tell us is that the Government of Italy is on the brink of collapse because of Mr Prodis determination to introduce tax increases and budget cuts demanded by the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs to bring Italy into line with the Maastricht Treaty It also does not mention the riots in Hungary following the Hungarian Prime Ministers revelations that he had lied morning noon and night about the tax increases and public spending that he had secretly promised that same Commissioner P Forcing many of our new members of the EU to abide by deflationary policies designed for the more developed economies of the euro zone is generating weak demand weak growth and mass unemployment This report also fails to mention that the Maastricht Treaty has turned the Eastern Europeans into secondclass citizens they have no chance of joining the euro zone in the foreseeable future while having to manage their economies in line with its requirements Sooner or later the people of Europe are going to get restless with a system that keeps them permanently in the economic slow lane while denying them any democratic say in how it should be run SK I would like to welcome and support the proposal by the opposition in the European Parliament concerning the 2006 declaration on the anniversary of the euro zone In particular I would like to highlight the passage calling for a thorough examination of the mechanism of the three Member States that are the best performers in terms of price stability and the methods for calculating the reference inflation rates P The point is that the varying rates of inflation among the euro zone Member States do not reflect different approaches to macroeconomic policy but are rather the result of structural factors This premise I believe applies especially to the new Member States of the European Union The relative share of energyintensive and raw materialintensive output in many of these countries is greater than in the euro zone A major portion of this output is then transported to the euro zone either directly or as part of finished products for instance in respect of the sheet metal used to manufacture car bodies P Because of these structural reasons the new Member States are more susceptible to fluctuations in the price of energy and raw materials by the same token they serve as a buffer that absorbs the impact of price changes on the euro zone This problem particularly affects the Slovak Republic P The current approach to assessing inflation criteria is therefore inappropriate and may in the long run diminish the chances of new Member States gaining entry to the euro zone even if they comply with all other requirements HU Mr President first of all I congratulate the Commission and the rapporteur for their consideration of this difficult subject I am particularly pleased with the remarks concerning the flexibility of the labour market and the goaloriented approach to education I believe that our conclusions point in a single direction As someone from one of the eastern European countries waiting to join the euro zone I would like to make only four brief remarks P First with respect to the enlargement of the euro zone no other standard for admission should be applied than the political standard that applies to those who are already inside P Second it is important that the new Member States join as soon as possible and therefore there can be no interpretation above all in the matter of inflation sustainability and the reference level which would in practice postpone for a long time the accession of the new Member States which are still lagging behind the EU economic average and are thus still in the process of catching up in terms of wage and price levels This is a point on which Mr Kozlík has given a very good explanation P Third I agree that the statistics of the Member States have to be closely monitored and that the Commission must respond with political tools if nothing else such as informing a European Summit if a Member State is particularly undisciplined and heading in the wrong direction In the long run turning a blind eye is unacceptable The Commission has a political responsibility as well in this regard P Fourth deepening the internal market is essential and it is important that everyone observes the criteria The new Member States are doing this However there is a contradiction on the one hand the labour market the Schengen zone remains closed to the new Member States and the LabourIntensive Services and the Posting of Workers directives are very restrictive On the other hand however we are obliged to open up the market in financial services to everyone This imbalance does not make the integration of Member States any easier from the perspective of deepening the internal market FR Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen this report contains several interesting and welcome recommendations for which I would like to thank the rapporteur P Thus instead of simply calling for public spending cuts the report recommends freeing up resources to make what are presumably necessary public investments in education training infrastructure and research P Furthermore instead of recommending wage cuts the European Parliament admits that is in fact the term that is used that in the long term real wages and productivity should grow simultaneously I would thank the rapporteur for his efforts at moderation and conciliation P However the subject of this debate is the economic performance of the euro zone In fact I believe that despite the recent and even unexpected improvement of growth indicators the economic situation remains fragile and unsatisfactory After all the Commissions macroeconomic policy affects the daily lives of millions of Europeans whose purchasing power I would point out is threatened by stagnating salaries and by an increase in the cost of living and whose working conditions continue to decline while social protection is also dwindling P The practical response offered by the Commission and the European Central Bank is always the same to fight inflation through budgetary austerity and wage cuts while increasing competition in the services capital products and labour markets P Perhaps the time has come to evaluate the results of this policy and to consider whether dismantling public services deregulating the labour market and cutting public expenditure really is a sustainable way of driving growth in the euro zone and in the European Union Unfortunately no period of reflection is on the agenda In two days we shall have to give our opinion on a services directive that is admittedly improved but that remains true to Fritz Bolkesteins deregulatory model P In a few months time we will have on our agenda a directive proposing the end of the public postal service As for energy despite the chronic instability of the oilproducing zones despite the gas blackmail exercised by a neighbouring country despite global warming and despite power cuts extending across half of Europe it is all to no avail and the response remains the same to complete the liberalised and deregulated internal energy market in Europe The euro zones economic report is perhaps a little better this year but its social and political performance remains in my eyes as bad as ever EL Mr President I have been listening to the speakers all this time especially the competent Commissioner Mr Almunia arguing in favour of the canonisation of the euro But is that really the case Perhaps what we are tying to canonise here in this Chamber is the bad demon of the citizens of Europe which we represent P The value of the euro rises and we are all delighted However at the same time the number of citizens living below the poverty line also rises Of the 500 million people in Europe of 27 100 million people are living below the poverty line In other words people who can only afford meat once a fortnight who cannot buy clothes for their children who cannot change their car until they have had it for 15 years What does the euro mean to these people P I would remind you that it started with an imperium We do not want one and two euro notes and yet 75 of daily transactions are below the 5 euro line We are delighted that the euro is rising It has risen from 087 cents to the dollar to 130 What does that mean No country which does not have proprietary products can sell to the United States of America or other countries Of course Germany can sell Mercedes because it is a Mercedes but how can my country which has no proprietary products sell to America the big market when it can find the same product in a neighbouring country outside EMU for a third of the price How will tourists come to Greece or Mr Almunia how will American tourists go to Spain when it is impossible to monitor the value of the euro P Can we not look at all this Can we not address all this It is a huge problem and you have a huge responsibility in the Commission especially you personally Mr Almunia DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen while we who live in the euro zone must of course make it our concern to leave our children in as little debt as possible not under any circumstances must we in our striving for a more vigorous economy dispense with social standards Whenever we are invited to compare our growth rate with that of the USA the lack of virtually any kind of social system in the United States must not be left out of the equation P I do not think that we are going to catch them up by forcing masses of public sector workers into retirement and privatising their jobs or by means of jobs paying EUR 1 an hour combined with the forcing of more and more staff into what appears to be selfemployment We have in the past seen more and more of the family silver being sold off in order to gain membership of the euro club and that must come to an end we must instead make the effort to get on top of the explosive growth of blackmarket work to cut down the bureaucratic hurdles that face small and mediumsized businesses some of which are becoming harder to surmount and make it easier for such businesses to get access to grants Only then will the euro zone have a future characterised by growth PL Mr President Commissioner it gives me great satisfaction to announce my support for the European Commissions presentation of the first annual report on the situation in the euro zone P The report provides a good basis for discussing the main challenges facing the euro zone now and in the coming years There is plenty to discuss The average growth rate in the euro zone in 20012005 was a mere 19 Unemployment rose to 13 million and the situation with public finances got worse rather than improving P Last year did bring a slight improvement in the situation as you were kind enough to confirm but this does not change the fact that Europe is falling further behind not just the United States and Japan but also the Asian boom countries Unresolved structural problems lie at the root of European stagnation The high cost of setting up and running a business high overheads on labour costs reluctance to innovate and the maintenance of harmful barriers to the labour market and the services market all reduce the competitiveness of European firms holding back growth and increasing pressure on public finances It prevents us from making full use of the opportunities offered by a common currency and a uniform monetary policy P I therefore call upon the European Commission to put pressure on the Member States to speed up implementation of the necessary reforms The need for this has been demonstrated in numerous reports and studies including the Shapiro report and the highlevel report made under the chairmanship of Wim Kok P Macroeconomic policy in the euro zone needs to be improved What is missing above all is proper coordination of fiscal policy among the Member States At the same time the common currency requires fiscal discipline which needs to be observed jointly by all Member States This will make it possible to balance macroeconomic policy and to restore a proper policy mix P Monetary policy needs to be based on clear transparent rules and must be more forwardlooking in character Excessive secrecy in decisionmaking lack of clear regulations on the role played by the two pillars of monetary policy particularly the M3 monetary supply which create serious doubts regarding the rules for appointing members of the board of the European Central Bank all restrict the effectiveness and transparency of the common monetary policy and may undermine the position of the common currency P A substantial element in strengthening the euro zone is expanding it and taking on new members In this process we must observe the rule that candidates are bound by the treaty the whole treaty and nothing but the treaty This means that they must meet the criteria set out in the treaty but also that additional requirements cannot be imposed upon them I am convinced that the accession of new euro zone members whose deficit and public debt levels are often much lower than those of the other Member States will help to strengthen the euro zone P In conclusion I would like to thank Mr Juncker the president of the Euro Group for taking part in our debate and hope that it will inspire him and help him to manage the Euro Group even better I would also like to thank Mr GarcíaMargallo y Marfil for preparing this excellent report and give my full agreement to the majority of the proposals made in it Member of the Commission ES Mr President thank you very much to all of the Members for their contributions I think that the debate shows that it is useful to have a report like this every year on the operation of the euro zone and its results this being the first time that it has been adopted by the Commission and is being debated in Parliament P As a conclusion to todays debate I can make an optimistic observation the euro zone is growing again despite the fact that some said that it was a zone of very low growth The euro zone is growing by 26 this year perhaps even more at the end of the financial year The euro zone is creating jobs and reducing unemployment According to our predictions between now and 2008 five million jobs are going to be created in the euro zone It is not said very often but it is true that since the beginning of this decade despite low growth in the euro zone and of course also in the whole of the European Union significantly more jobs have been created than in the United States which always establish themselves as the reference point to be imitated in policies and strategies for job creation P I therefore think that if we analyse the operation of the area and the results that we are achieving through monetary integration there are elements that could justify a moderately optimistic assessment However it is also true that there are elements that should continue to attract our attention as there is still a great deal to do P There is still a great deal to do as many of you have said in order to increase potential growth and continue to reduce unemployment so that greater growth and a higher level of employment can improve the lives of our citizens reduce inequalities and offer more solid bases for our social protection systems and for our social services system This firstly requires as many of you have said that we continue to comply and comply better with the stability and budgetary discipline criteria laid down in the Treaty and implemented through the application of the Stability and Growth Pact which is being applied in a reasonably positive way on which there is a consensus We also need to continue with the reforms and go further with the Lisbon Strategy because this plan of eliminating barriers and facilitating the four freedoms has proven to be a solid basis for creating better conditions in which to face the future P It also requires according to the analysis and many of its conclusions better governance in the euro zone I think that the efficiency of the operation of the Eurogroup since it has had a stable presidency led by Mr Juncker who is with us today has improved It is enabling us to make better progress in analysis mutual understanding and coordinating decisions that affect the Member States but which cannot be imposed on them from above and need to be adopted by consensus with their full conviction and in accordance with their competences We also need to strengthen dialogue P If any of you still have any doubts ladies and gentlemen in the opinion of the Commission and in my opinion as the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs we need to enhance bilateral dialogue between the Commission and Parliament on these matters I think that we need to move forward in a tripartite dialogue between the Presidency of the Eurogroup the Commission and Parliament on the following matters the operation of the Eurogroup on any subjects that draw our attention and if you agree I also think that we need to move forward with a dialogue including while fully respecting its independence the European Central Bank and why not which has a monetary dialogue with you but also has a monthly dialogue with us I think that Parliament can and should every now and again be part of this exchange of views between all of the institutions whose common goal is for the euro zone to operate correctly and for the euro our common currency to produce the best possible results for all the citizens of Europe President of Eurogroup FR Mr President I should like first of all to apologise for being late The LuxembourgStrasbourg route is terribly congested at the entrance to Strasbourg and traffic jams prevented me from arriving on time Being conscious not to disturb the peace and quiet of the people of Strasbourg I did not want to go all out I scrupulously adhered to the highway code and I was the first to suffer since I have arrived late for this debate Nevertheless I should like to tell you that I attach importance to this debate because Parliaments thoughts are not only important in themselves but they also sustain the debates within Eurogroup which I chair assisted inspired driven and spurred on by the Commissioner for Monetary Affairs my friend Mr Almunia P I should like to begin by saying Mr President that I believe that we have strong growth it is expanding and it is not under threat despite the attempts to dampen it down particularly on the part of France The employment rate is rising and unemployment is going down although it has not attained acceptable levels As regards growth if we look at it in perspective it is probably stronger than we think at present and is at any rate stronger than we thought six months ago P In 2007 we shall have to see to what extent the cyclical slowdown in the United States affects the economic performance of the euro zone At Eurogroup we believe that the impact of the US slowdown on the euro zone economies will be less marked than in 20002001 We see that the US cyclical slowdown is primarily hitting the building sector and that it is not going to spread to other sectors of the US economy Thus the impact on growth in the euro zone will be less marked than before even though the countrybycountry results will reveal some big differences P Why have we attained a level of growth that seems more acceptable to us today than it did a few years ago Firstly because the euro has protected us to a huge extent over the past few years It is never said enough when the introduction of the euro is reviewed the euro has protected us is protecting us and will continue to protect us Imagine the state of the European economy and the state of the European monetary systems if the euro had not existed during times of crisis During this period when preliminary work was being done on the euro we witnessed the Latin American Russian and South East Asian financial crises Imagine how out of control our system would have let things get before the European system was implemented at the time of the war in Iraq and of 11 September 2001 Imagine what the performance of the European currencies would be if they still existed while the geostrategic dramas being played out are a constant cause for concern Imagine how certain national currencies would have performed after the French and Dutch No votes The euro has protected us and it has even protected countries that expressed some misgivings about Europe when it came to their approving the Constitutional Treaty P The budgetary situation improved when in all wisdom and with the agreement and often even the active support of Parliament we amended and reformed the Stability and Growth Pact Some people felt they were entitled to express their grave concerns following the adoption of the reformed pact We see today that the mechanisms of the reformed pact are holding up well and that all the governments are making every effort to implement the main rules and guiding principles contained therein The budget deficits are decreasing and a general consensus is emerging which is aimed at all of the Member States taking the prevention aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact seriously they have all decided to allocate as a priority the fiscal surpluses resulting from the cyclical upturn to the reduction in the deficit and to the reduction in the level of public debt I welcome that decision P We at Eurogroup are giving more thought to stepping up budgetary controls and we are doing so together with the Commission whose cordial manner of assisting Eurogroups presidency is proving to be very effective We will see during our next meeting which will be held towards the end of November and thus after my visit to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs which you Mrs Berès expertly chair how we can step up these budgetary controls We will do so from now on on the basis of a Commission horizontal report which will not fail to emphasise the real political problems that exist including the politicaleconomic ones or to draft specific recommendations the form of which we have yet to decide on to the various Member States and even to the entire euro zone P With regard to the currency area as a whole I should like us to take what is by now a longstanding invitation from the Commission seriously this year and that is to devote a specific chapter of the European Councils conclusions when it examines the progress made by the Lisbon Strategy to the euro zone a chapter that includes the structural reforms that we will have to implement within the various member states of the euro zone P As regards the structural reform problem I would quite simply say Mr President that we underestimate the value that these structural reforms have already added to the coherence of the euro zone I do not agree with all or in general some of the structural reforms that have been implemented within all the Member States but the fact is that contrary to the idea to the image that we very often present of the euro zone an important raft of structural reforms is underway and we are now already reaping the rewards of this farreaching structural reform that we have implemented with regard to the euro zone P When you look closely at the national reform programmes that the various Member States have introduced you will see that there are many structural solutions that they are generally in line with each other and that we must proceed further with this raft of reforms without for all that lapsing into unsavoury neoliberalism and into a boundless shameless form of frenetic deregulation to which I am opposed because I still believe that the euro and the euro zone and the consistency of the policies that we will be implementing would gain in credibility if we supplemented our work on structural reforms with the implementation of a set of minimum social rights This would guarantee all workers throughout the euro zone a number of minimum rights which the Member States in trying to enhance their national fighting spirits could not undermine P Workers in Europe have a right to know where they stand We must stop giving the impression that the monetary Union is a business that is run by the ministers of finance the bankers and the big investors and big businesses and that it actually works against the most basic rights of workers who do after all make up the majority of the population in Europe P I should like to say a word about the enlargement of the euro zone I disagree with all those who imply that we in the euro zone have become stricter than before towards the new Member States which want to join the zone The criteria that we are applying are those laid down in the Treaty of Maastricht There has been no demand to change the criteria that we adopted when the Treaty was signed in Maastricht on 7 February 1992 There is no question of abandoning the nominal convergence policy so as to replace it with a criterion that would omit the application of certain criteria which the first members of the euro zone had to meet As for those who call into question the nominal convergence criteria in nontheoretical terms I would guard them against the genuine risks of seeing the nominal convergence criteria replaced by real convergence criteria The application of real convergence criteria would make the new Member States accession to the euro zone a very distant prospect I therefore think that we would be wise to confine ourselves to the criteria that are currently ours and this policy will enhance the credibility of the euro zone P The way in which the euro zone is represented outside Europe does in fact warrant a lengthy explanation but a brief explanation may suffice The euro zone must be represented by a man by a voice and by a seat within every international institution and particularly within the international financial organisations I am convinced that we will not have reached that stage when my term in office comes to an end on 1 January 2009 Nevertheless I firmly believe that the day will come when even the most reticent of Europeans will realise that we are constantly making fools of ourselves in aspiring to comanage the worlds monetary affairs if we continue to appear in international forums without a common plan of action There you have a few comments that I felt it my right to make while I apologise for not having been able to reply to all of the speakers as I usually do I had to reply briefly because I was not present when the speakers with the commitment that characterises this Parliament took the floor The debate is closed P The vote will take place on Tuesday at 1130 P Written statement Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure FR Even though the report by my excellent colleague Mr GarciaMargallo y Marfil puts forward some very interesting analyses and proposals on the euro zone I regret the fact that it does not raise the issue straightaway of the development of the euro from a technical currency to a political tool benefiting growth and employment The monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank ECB seems to be at odds with reality the exchange rate should normally be strong when there is strong economic growth and should depreciate when there is weak growth The fact is that in Europe the opposite has been true since the start of the 1990s While the Member States are undergoing reforms the quest for zero inflation through an inappropriate monetary policy is leading Europe to record mediocre results in terms of economic growth P If this state of affairs continues at a time when the price of raw materials and of energy is rocketing worldwide we will have zero inflation and zero growth and manufacturers will end up setting up their businesses in the dollar zone With everything that is happening it is as though the ECB is disregarding economic policy while its US counterpart is thinking of nothing else",

    "input": "Community action in the field of marine environmental policy Thematic strategy on the marine environment debate The next items on the agenda are P the joint debate on the report by MarieNoëlle Lienemann on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety on the proposed Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on community action in the field of marine environmental policy Thematic strategy on the marine environment Marine Strategy Directive C6 03462005 P the report by Aldis Kušķis on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety on the thematic strategy for protection and preservation of the marine environment Member of the Commission CS Mr President ladies and gentlemen I am delighted to be able to launch this joint debate on the thematic strategy for protecting and preserving the marine environment and on the proposed Marine Strategy Directive P I should like to thank both rapporteurs Mrs Lienemann for the proposed Marine Strategy Directive and Mr Kuskis for the thematic strategy I also wish to thank the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety for their efforts Furthermore I should like to thank the Committee on Fisheries and in particular Mr Gklavakis for his highly constructive approach to this important issue P Seas and oceans cover 71 of the Earths surface and contain 90 of the biosphere Europes marine waters extend across 3 million square kilometres the same area as mainland Europe in other words 50 of Europes territory is covered by sea Marine ecosystems play a key role in climate and weather patterns P The status of Europes marine environment is rapidly deteriorating however In some areas we may have gone past the point of no return Nutrient supply has a major influence on the Baltic Seas marine environment Fish populations are in a poor state throughout Europe The Northeast Atlantic has one of the highest shipping levels in the world with all of the risks and consequences that that implies The Mediterranean is under serious threat from uncontrolled development of its coastline P If we are to reverse these trends however the existing measures and efforts be they at international national or EU level are clearly inadequate Most measures drawn up at EU level were not geared towards protecting the marine environment as such and they therefore have a limited impact It has been demonstrated that measures adopted at international level are very difficult to implement or promote because they are not binding P A healthy marine environment is crucially important both for life as a whole and for the quality of our lives It is also an essential prerequisite for fulfilling the economic potential of the oceans and seas A dynamic marine economy can flourish only where there is a healthy marine environment The Marine Strategy will therefore make a significant contribution to the growth and employment goals enshrined in the Lisbon Strategy P For the reasons outlined above it is clear that the protection of the marine environment cannot and must not simply be a byproduct of other policies At EU level what is needed is an integrated strategy that takes into account all of the pressures and influences on the marine environment P This is precisely what the thematic strategy on the marine environment seeks to achieve It consists of the proposed Marine Strategy Directive and a report detailing the current state of affairs On a broader level it covers the EUs environmental record on the marine environment and explains why the EU needs to take action P Marine strategy must be viewed within the broader context of a new marine policy for the EU According to the Commissions Green Paper drawn up in June the objective of the new policy is a dynamic European marine economy operating in harmony with the marine environment The marine strategy is within the area of the environment one of the pillars of the future marine policy It will be based on the specific activities needed to protect marine ecosystems which provide the sustainable wealth productivity and employment opportunities and from a broader perspective peoples livelihood from the oceans and seas P The purpose of this Marine Strategy Directive is to achieve good environmental status in the EU marine environment by 2021 in other words to restore the environmental health of our seas over the next 15 years This date will coincide with the first review of River Basin Management Plans under the EU Water Framework Directive allowing for synergies on the further implementation of both directives The joint implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Directive thus brings together the protection of both marine and freshwater environments P The directive establishes European Marine Regions on the basis of geographical and environmental criteria and defines subregions as management units for implementation P At an EU level no managementrelated measures will be adopted In the first phase the Member States will be tasked with developing a marine strategy for the seas in each of their regions and proposing practical solutions to address the specific needs of those seas Marine strategy should firstly include taking stock of the marine environment and the threats and pressures it faces setting further environmental goals and indicators and establishing monitoring programmes In the second phase the Member States will be required to draw up and implement measures aimed at achieving good environmental status P Cooperation is of vital importance between Member States and with the third countries with which Member States share saltwater bodies In order to achieve this objective Member States will need to work within the framework of the regional marine conventions Regional conventions are invaluable partners when it comes to strategy implementation as is evidenced by their long track record of scientific and technical competence and the fact that they are able to work effectively at a regional level P To conclude I should like to stress the importance and sensitivity of marine ecosystems A high level of protection for the marine environment is a vital prerequisite for deriving the maximum economic benefit from the oceans and seas The marine environment is clearly the foundation of our marine economy P The marine environment is under threat Consequently the EU must act effectively proactive I hope that the proposed strategy will contribute towards achieving that aim rapporteur FR Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen allow me first of all as rapporteur to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs from the various groups and the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety for supporting a joint piece of work aimed at enhancing the Commission proposal P As you said Commissioner the seas and oceans of our planet are in a worrying state a crisis point has been reached Moreover a recent study published in the Science review sounded the alarm bell by highlighting the risks of fishery resources disappearing from our seas and oceans P The quality of the marine ecosystem plays a fundamental role in the planets global environment and in particular plays a very important role in regulating the climate Our seas also play a decisive role in peoples lives in every part of the globe As you pointed out they play a major economic role when it comes to fishing transport tourism sources of raw materials or even activities carried out along the coastlines that border them Yet our seas and oceans are subjected to growing pressure and worrying pollution P Let us first address this figure 80 of maritime pollution comes from the land and as you said Commissioner there is clearly a direct link between the framework directive on water and the directive that you have presented and that our Parliament wishes to enhance P However if pollution comes from the earth via water then it also comes via the atmosphere Recent studies show a significant interaction between atmospheric movements air pollution and the sea and oceans such that urbanisation and human activities taking place far away from the coasts may have a direct impact on the quality of water Pollution is also caused by activities linked to the exploitation of the oceans and seas such as transport and aquaculture A few years ago waste produced by fishing and oil industry activity reached altogether excessive and dangerous levels in certain sectors P We are also at a time when we can see new threats looming which the directive must anticipate In particular we are seeing a large increase in the number of projects aimed at desalinating seawater We have to be certain that these activities are not going to affect the quality of water in the future Major international debates are taking place on the storage of carbon dioxide Thus we can see that the threats are indeed real P The aim of the directive has been to implement a structure enabling us finally to have access to a strategy that goes beyond international agreements the results of which have mostly not lived up to our hopes thus far P Our directive is based on a fundamental point restoring the good ecological status of seas Parliament would like Commissioner the requirement for results to be far more present and far stronger than the text in its current state provides for P Secondly our Parliament would like the good ecological status of seas and oceans to be defined with a great deal more precision so that this is not some sort of pious hope and so that we come closer to doing what can be done to restore the life and balance of the ecosystem P Thirdly our Parliament would like the deadlines to be shorter and at any rate we would like there to be a good balance between the deadlines the level of the demands regarding good ecological status and the requirement for results P Finally we advocate the creation of marine protected areas because the experiences of the Americans and the New Zealanders have shown that these protected areas indeed in some cases these genuine marine reserves were such as to enable fish stocks to be built up again P Finally we would like territorial cohesion to be enhanced by an effective piece of work carried out at marine and submarine regional level without however the Member States being exempted from their responsibilities in view of the objectives set by the management plans and the plans for measures aimed at restoring good ecological status P We are anxious to include the Black Sea in the document We would like to sound the alarm bell concerning the Arctic we need to think about the future of this part of the world It is directly linked to us and its development has a considerable impact on the future of the planet which may be endangered as a result We would like the outermost regions of the Union which do not yet feature in the document gradually to become at least the subject of an appropriate strategy P I shall conclude by mentioning the democratic issues We see everyday whether we are talking about fishing or transport that sea users ecologists and scientists feel the need to exchange their points of view so that the decisions that are taken are taken on the basis of a shared diagnosis and of a rational analysis of the problems In any case that is the spirit of the amendments that we have tabled rapporteur LV Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for your cooperation so far and the valuable proposals that you have submitted so that together we may improve the Commissions proposal on the thematic strategy for the protection and preservation of the marine environment I very much hope that this report will foster real changes that will preserve and improve the marine ecological environment I am happy that the report also touches on as sensitive an issue as the problems of the Baltic sea environment In the Baltic sea which is also known as Europes internal lake it is particularly important to preserve the balance of the ecosystem by not allowing it to be further threatened and by taking special account of the specific low water exchange indicator I would like to emphasise on this point that the European Parliament ought also to scrupulously assess and join in monitoring the design and construction of a gas pipeline which is hazardous for the Baltic sea environment In my view it is important for the people of Europe and particularly those whose countries border the sea to be able to personally see positive changes the fact that water quality and cleanness is increasing that a renewal of biological diversity is taking place in the seas and finally that there is considered balanced and sustainable administration and development of the marine region following the adoption of this legislation and similar pieces of legislation I would like to stress that this report is the product of collaboration with nongovernmental organisations and representatives of this field in industry with whom wideranging debates took place even before the expiry of the deadline for submitting proposals and that many of their ideas were included in the report Finally ladies and gentlemen I would like to urge the European Commission and also ourselves to talk less but to work more and achieve concrete results so that we may all live without fear beside our seas P From this point I shall switch to English and speaking also for my colleague Mrs Korhola who cannot be here today for this debate share some comments and messages P The thematic strategy is decided on under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme That is very necessary As the Commissioner has rightly said for some time we have needed a strong integrated EU policy on marine protection The EU marine strategy directive will be an important new instrument in integrating the existing approaches Great things have already been achieved with the various policies legislation programmes action plans and various international conventions but still the state of the marine environment has been deteriorating at an alarming pace We need more overall joint action P There are big challenges such as the role of third countries which might raise some questions But if third countries turn out to be the biggest polluters and if they think of this as only a European Union matter how do we ensure that actions and efforts put in place by the Member States produce good results when for one reason or another third countries do not cooperate We have tried to address the issues in committee but we shall only find out later how this actually works P The rapporteur Mrs Lienemann has done some excellent work influenced strongly by the NGOs and she has been very environmentally ambitious She has made some radical changes and integrated ideas into the report that were widely requested by the stakeholders In general the rapporteur has made the directive stronger and more concrete more ambitious and effective She has added the much needed guidelines and criteria and has tightened up the time limits P Building on the rapporteurs approach we have a solid chance to make this a real environmental pillar for marine policy as planned Here are a few key elements of the draft report The time limits and schedules for achieving good environmental status have been tightened up from 2021 to 2017 General definitions of measures which Member States are to take in order to achieve good environmental status are added and a detailed list of GES criteria is provided P There is no clear definition of European marine waters The Black Sea has been added as one marine region in the directive Preparation timetables are tighter as are programmes of measures Marineprotected areas are added something that was not mentioned before More emphasis is given to cooperation by Member States in the same marine region in monitoring programmes etc More emphasis is laid on third countries in broadening responsibilities and deciding who should be involved P All in all this report is making a strong point from the European Parliament side that we need effective measures to tackle this important issue Mr President the main objective of the proposed directive is to achieve a good marine environmental status P This strategy is more urgent today than at any other time because the marine ecosystem has deteriorated significantly However in order for this strategy to be effective we must pay attention to two or three things P First we have a saying in my country that you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs The money budgeted for this action is very very little Provision has been made for administrative expenses alone for approximately EUR 90 million per annum for the first two years and for EUR 70 million per annum thereafter I think this sum is inadequate Saving our seas is such a serious issue that it merits our spending more money P Secondly we need coordinated actions First of all we must make fishermen our partners in this endeavour We must come to an agreement with them they must be persuaded that first of all they need to protect the environment but that is not all all of us involved in transport tourism industry health nutrition agriculture and above all fisheries must sit at the same table so that we can agree and proceed P The third thing I wanted to say was touched on by Commissioners Borg and Dimas and that is that we must agree on certain common indicators so that we can measure the environmental status at the moment so that and this is very important when we speak of a good marine environmental status we are referring to the same thing In other words we must agree on common measurements P To close I wish to say and to emphasise that the directive on the marine strategy must give fisheries its proper place and must be at the heart of the endeavour on behalf of the PPEDE Group FI Mr President first I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work and at the same time I want to thank the Commission which has embarked on this important project The Commissioner with responsibility for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Mr Borg himself in fact organised a conference on maritime transport safety in July in my home town of Turku at which these important matters were discussed This is just the sort of proper work which we in the EU should be doing together P I would in particular like to raise the matter of the Baltic Sea as the Baltic is an important EU sea though at present it is a blot on the landscape The Baltic Sea is seriously ill Let me give you an example of this Last summer bluegreen algae took over the entire sea aided by the warm weather It is hard to explain to your little children who want to go and swim that they cannot go in the sea because not only is it dirty it is actually toxic There are toxic algae in the sea and that can cause various diseases in children if they go and swim in the sea in warm weather P Now the Commission and all of us are being urged to take swift and determined action and provide the resources needed to rescue the Baltic Sea That will of course mean that much action will have to be taken One excellent project now under way is the financing of the St Petersburg sewage plant This is one of the most important examples We also need dialogue with Russia for example in the area of safety regulations for shipping We will not succeed if we do not work closely with Russia P Saving the Baltic Sea is no longer just an environmental issue It is above all a political one on behalf of the PSE Group FI Mr President it is no exaggeration to say that Europes marine regions are in a crisis and there is an urgent need to take action to protect the seas Over the next 50 years for example fish stocks are threatened with collapse The Commission proposal for a directive in the field of Marine Environmental Policy and a Marine Strategy is a way to seek a panEuropean integrated approach to saving marine ecosystems Although all our seas are in a poor state it is only reasonable to examine the question of their protection from a regional perspective Marine regions vary in terms of their characteristics and at least some of the problems are essentially local What they all have in common however is that they should all be capable of achieving good ecological status within a specific period of time Hopefully that will be before the year 2021 P The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the rapporteurs endeavour to define what we mean by good environmental status in the marine environment To achieve good status as defined we need to establish sufficiently stringent conservation objectives to prevent deterioration and for measures for the recovery of the seas and restoring them to a sustainable level These measures may be quite tough but I hope that the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats will support them in the vote It is important that the measures are properly binding and not merely recommendations P The protection of the seas is about cooperation not just among the Member States of the EU but also with third countries with links to marine regions For example effective protection of the Baltic Sea region cannot succeed without Russias commitment to cooperation For years now there has been cooperation in the context of HELCOM or the Helsinki Commission HELCOM is presently overseeing a Baltic Sea Action Plan Conservation action under the strategy should start within the framework of the HELCOM Action Plan so that practical measures can be taken as swiftly as possible in the Baltic Sea region I would like to thank both the rapporteurs for having adopted this view within the context both of the strategy and of the directive on behalf of the ALDE Group Mr President having a marine strategy that does not concentrate on fish is like filling a goldfish bowl with clean water after the cat has already taken and eaten the goldfish P Having said that there is strong support in this House for the principles behind this strategy and for the legislation and that is hardly surprising given the catastrophic picture the Commission has painted of the state of our seas We need to introduce protective measures that are enforceable through the courts in order to ensure that Member States apply them P The Commissioner used strong words which we welcome but the proposals originally submitted to Parliament highlighted some of the weaknesses and divisions within the Commission itself One thing we are most pleased about is the fact that the whole idea of good environmental status has been reinserted into the proposals and given a clear definition and we are united on there being powers to create marine protected zones However why were those ideas not in the Commissions original document When it came out of DG Environment they were but by the time it emerged from the College some of these crucial matters had been deleted The time has come for the Commission to back up its fine words on sustainability with some united action from the Commissioners of each department P We hear that there are divergent views in the Council so be it But the message to the Commission and the Council from this Parliament should be that there is strong crossparty support for a significant improvement and strengthening of the measures being proposed The Commission was right to draft these proposals but let us now ensure that the warm sentiments can be transformed into practical action on behalf of the VertsALE Group SV Mr President I wish to thank the rapporteurs for their exemplary work and their excellent reports They improve the Commissions proposal by demanding that good environmental status be achieved by 2017 instead of 2021 Moreover the targets are made binding and the importance of marine reserves is emphasised P Climate change waste unsustainable fishing noise eutrophication and the extraction of raw materials threaten our seas If the mass destruction and the natural disaster taking place in the depths of the oceans were instead to be taking place visibly on land the debate on the protection of the marine environment would dominate everyday discourse Species of fish birds and mammals are threatened by extinction The Marine Strategy can in fact be a small step in trying to get to grips with the problems but only if it is as ambitious as the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety proposes P The Member States must assume their responsibility for setting up significantly more marine reserves We have national parks in all the Member States but marine reserves are conspicuous by their absence where they are most needed There is overwhelming statistical evidence that marine reserves provide protection that increases both the fish population and biological diversity in the immediate surroundings of the reserves When fish are protected and are thus able to increase in numbers the older fish disperse and make for better catches The Baltic Sea in particular is an extremely sensitive sea with brackish water The countries around the Baltic Sea must always be entitled to introduce more stringent water protection requirements if they think it necessary to do so without as a consequence being constantly threatened by protracted legal proceedings because the internal market has to take precedence over protection of our seas P I wish to point out the importance of the committees call for no support to be given to agricultural activity involving largescale nutrient leakage into the seas My Amendments 81 and 82 are designed to introduce responsible regulation of discharges from waste disposal sites The original proposal is too weak on this point I am opposed to Amendment 90 about removing the reference to radioactive substances because doing so would be contrary to the original objective from 2002 Finally the Maritime Strategys call for utilisation of the seas must be adjusted and altered so that it falls within the framework of the Marine Strategy Mr President Commissioner I should like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the excellent work she has done in the report and to stress that she has managed with a great deal of success to include in her report the views of all the members and of nongovernmental organisations and as a result she has improved the Commissions original paper significantly P The marine environment which is a basic and valuable source of life is under daily threat Maritime pollution climate change shipping and coastal developments continue to threaten the marine environment and to have an adverse impact on human health P The directive in question which is designed to plug the gaps in environmental policy is an important step towards improving health and restoring the seas P It is important for us to support amendments requiring the Member States to achieve a good environmental status amendments which recognise the threats to the marine environment and which aim for the shortest possible timeframe for the implementation of the directive I refer to Amendments 24 27 73 and 78 which I urge you to support P Furthermore actions by the Member States must be based on the principle of prevention on an approach based on the ecosystem while at the same time account must be taken of accurate evaluations carried out on the basis of current European legislation as referred to in Amendments 23 49 45 51 and 60 P Finally I call on you to support Amendments 81 and 82 banning any systematic or deliberate dumping of any liquid gaseous or solid body in the water or on the sea bed in keeping with the provisions laid down for carbon dioxide except where the relevant approval is granted in accordance with international law and a prior environmental impact study is carried out in accordance with the directive on behalf of the UEN Group IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen the two reports under discussion could not have come at a better time since they examine the notorious construction of the Baltic pipeline a project that in the absence of a serious environmental impact assessment risks causing an ecological disaster in a sea already suffering moreover from a worrying level of pollution Not only that the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean where fish stocks are becoming ever more scarce also suffer in some areas from a high level of pollution caused among other things by oil extraction and above all by oil refining I refer in particular to the industrial triangle of Syracuse in Sicily which is the largest petrochemical complex in Europe P In this industrial zone not only is there an extremely high level of air pollution causing the tragedy of birth defects and the indefensible death rate due to tumours over 57 higher in fact than the Italian average but there is also the problem of marine pollution The consequences are obvious the poorquality fish stocks are down to critical levels fishermen often small operators either cover more miles to find better fishing waters or are forced to give up their traditional livelihoods As if that were not enough plans are underway to construct a regasifier in this industrial zone a project I have condemned several times before this House P The proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive and the appropriate amendments that in our opinion improve it are therefore very welcome Mr President Above all I hope that it will shorten the timescale for achieving the objectives of a healthy ecology and environment We need to make up for the severe delays that Europe has accumulated in this sector and as we all know political timing does not always coincide with the needs of the environment From this evening we can afford to be a little more optimistic on behalf of the INDDEM Group PL Mr President the marine environment has faced various threats for a long time now which is why a farreaching marine strategy is a necessity The European Union has territorial waters greater than its entire territory with 1 200 ports and 90 of its exports are transported by sea We consider it crucial to emphasise the interdependence of a common fisheries policy and the proposed marine environment strategy It is logical and advisable to allow a hazardous vessel that has been penalised to sail to the nearest shelter and then to the nearest available shipyard provided that it does not pose a health or environmental threat P Another proposal worthy of attention is that of declaring the Arctic a nature reserve dedicated to peace and science I have the privilege of representing Scotland in this Parliament and that means I also represent a large share of the EUs indigenous resources of oil and gas As I understand it we are committed to maximising the potential of our indigenous energy resources Surely this is only sensible for economic and logistical reasons and for security of supply It is also the case that the extraction of hydrocarbons in the North Sea is already well regulated in all its environmental and ecological aspects Yet certain amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety will effectively stop exploitation of these resources That is just plain absurd Indeed these amendments will even I understand cause suspension of a major offshore wind project in the Moray Firth Much of the research funding for this came from the European Union P Do we want to look ridiculous Do we want to hobble our few indigenous energy resources and become even more dependent on one or two dominant and often domineering external suppliers The North Seas ecology must be considered holistically in North Sea terms The North Sea is not the Mediterranean P I appeal to the rapporteur and other sensible groups to support the PPEDE amendments which will make this proposal ambitious yes but also responsible and practical SV Mr President I wish to thank Mrs Lienemann and Mr Kušķis who I think have done a very good job indeed on these directives P I myself live by the Baltic Sea and have therefore unfortunately been able to see at extremely close quarters the significance not only for individual people but also for employment and growth of the seas ecosystems being out of balance I also know that people expect us in this House to make a vigorous effort and do something about the problems they experience every day I therefore hope that tomorrow Parliament will not listen to the previous speakers but will instead give broad support to the changes backed by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety P Firstly it should support a considerably accelerated process whereby the measures are implemented earlier together with a timetable significantly more ambitious than the one proposed by the Commission specifying precisely when the objective of good environmental status in our seas is to be achieved Secondly it should support more clearly defined objectives that just as Mrs Lienemann said are a guarantee of our in actual fact achieving something and are not in the end just so much empty talk Thirdly it should support making what is perhaps the sea in the worst situation namely the Baltic into a pilot area for this strategy an area in which the measures are implemented particularly early and are preferably based on the Helsinki Convention These measures are needed if the Baltic Sea is to be saved SV Mr President two weeks ago Nicholas Stern a former World Bank employee published on behalf of the British Government a shocking report on the consequences of climate change The message was plain We must no longer think of nature as being something without value as if we do so the consequences may be incalculable The same also applies to the state of the sea P We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have prepared a number of amendments in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety They are all aimed at increasing the level of ambition bringing stricter timetables about strengthening cooperation with third countries such as Russia and plugging loopholes in the legislation One serious loophole for example is in relation to the international waters that begin 12 nautical miles off the coast In the vulnerable Baltic Sea mainly cargo ships but also passenger vessels continue to dump latrine waste straight into the sea That is something that they are able to do legally in international waters Out in the Baltic 1 800 vessels are dumping in more ways than one all the time The mind boggles We are pleased that the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs with whom we have worked are taking on board our amendment about plugging this loophole in the law The amendment needs to be implemented quickly without the decision getting caught up for years in the International Maritime Organisations decisionmaking machinery P We must have a high level of ambition The EU must support Russia in its efforts to cleanse St Petersburg of all waste water It will be expensive but not to take action would be still more expensive Drilling for oil and the laying of gas pipelines must not out of economic considerations take precedence over the environmental risks presented by such activities The harmful effects of traffic too must be reduced P I believe that our populations wish to see the EU genuinely able to take action on these issues pertaining to the fate of humanity Only in that way can we increase confidence in the EU The objective must be to protect Europes seas and restore them to their former state and to ensure that human activities are conducted in a sustainable way Mr President the European Union has 68 000 kilometres of coastline Scotland has 11 000 kilometres Almost 50 of the EU population live within 50 kilometres of the sea in Scotland 70 live within 10 kilometres of the sea Clearly it is in Scotlands longterm interests to protect the marine environment and to conserve its wealth of marine resources for the long term P Scotland has oil and gas reserves for at least another 30 years I will be supporting various amendments that will ensure that oil and gas extraction can continue to benefit the Scottish and EU economies P I cannot support committee Amendment 8 in the Lienemann report as drafted because it seeks to link the marine strategy to the principles of the common fisheries policy The CFP has been a miserable failure and the last thing I want to see is a new marine strategy linked to such a flawed set of principles P The idea that Member States should determine what good environmental status is in waters under their jurisdiction and work with their neighbours in logical marine regions makes a lot of sense Fisheries management should be brought into that common sense situation and jurisdiction should be returned to the Member States so that for example countries around the North Sea can work together with those who have most to gain from conservation being encouraged giving the incentive to make a marine strategy succeed EL Mr President systems to protect the marine environment are covered in a fragmentary manner by various sectoral policies of the European Union with the result however that there is a compilation of policies legislative acts programmes and action plans without any overall integrated policy for protecting the marine environment P The aim pursued in the two combined legislative arrangements on the thematic strategy on the protection and conservation of the environment and the marine strategy directive is to achieve a good environmental status of the marine environment in the European Union by 2021 However if we take account firstly of the more general nature of the two arrangements and secondly of the pillars on which they are based it is certain that in 2021 not only will there not be a good marine environmental status but there will hardly have been any improvement to the present poor status which is directly acknowledged in the explanatory statement to the proposal for a directive which points out that overall there has been a fundamental deterioration in the marine environment over recent decades P The substantiated scientific data of the United Nations Organisation concerning the causes of the deterioration and pollution of the marine environment are incontrovertible they are shore industries and shipping and the nonexistent or underdeveloped infrastructures for storing and processing residues P More importantly the pillars on which both the thematic strategy and the proposal for a directive are based are the common fisheries policy and the Green Paper on the European Unions shipping policy all of course within the framework of the 6th Environment Action Programme for the period from 20022012 which we have acutely condemned P In our opinion these are in essence numerous insubstantial interventions on the same wavelength as the Commission proposal the most daring and ambitious aim of which is to bring the deadline forward from 2021 to 2017 P The President cut off the speaker ES Mr President I would like warmly to congratulate Mrs Lienemann and I am not doing so in a superficial way or because protocol requires it I think that this Directive has achieved something important Thanks to her extensive experience she has an extraordinary knowledge of philosophy and of European legislative formulas and has achieved a succinct short Directive Despite the number of amendments it does not have too much in it and her own amendments are very generic ideas that are typical of a framework directive I know for a fact that she worked with experts and was open to many suggestions amendments were not even needed in order for some of them to be incorporated P I would like to say that it is an extraordinary and wonderful thing that finally Europe is discussing the sea Its time has come I would however also like to say that this Directive should be the start of a subsequent development of legislation as precisely because it is a framework directive there are still many aspects that need to be developed in the future which is what I want to talk about P For example Amendment 27 which is practically the same as Amendment 86 tabled by my group suggests several aspects that should be developed among other things activities at sea many industrial activities many of which are new such as desalination which I am not against but it has not yet been studied and the methodologies for studying the marine environmental impact which are practically in their infancy that is they have not yet been done P I also think that the indicators should be developed more and that digital marine charts should be drawn up which should also be used for cultural purposes P I think that one of the great treasures of world and European history are archaeological charts This is something that needs to be developed in order to preserve our heritage and I think that it will be one of the most stimulating discoveries for all of us EL Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen allow me to congratulate my honourable friend Mrs Lienemann on her complete and detailed work P It is now essential that the European Union acquire an integrated policy for the protection of the marine environment because the fragmentary legislation which has applied to date has not managed to reverse the reduction in biodiversity and the loss of habitats It is our duty therefore towards future generations to achieve a very high level of protection of the marine environment so that our strategy on sustainable development can be combined with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy not forgetting that in many countries in Europe and for a substantial section of the populace the sea is a large pole of economic development P At the same time this directive offers the Member States an historic opportunity to collaborate in a field which until recently was a field of conflict and antagonism such as sea fishing areas and fishing quotas P The basic objective must be to clearly define the term good environmental status of marine ecosystems so as to achieve a cohesive and effective marine policy at European Union level P I believe that adopting protected marine areas as a tool for protecting ecosystems and combating the reduction in biodiversity will also help considerably in achieving this objective At the same time we are calling for the deadlines for attaining the targets of the proposed directive to be brought forward to 2017 Mr President I wish to congratulate Mrs Lienemann and Mr Kušķis on their excellent reports which despite the view of some Scottish colleagues have been wisely strengthened by the Committee on The Environment Public Health and Food Safety P European marine waters as indeed international waters have often become the dustbin for waste of varying quantities and levels of toxicity This practice has been carried out for many years by individuals companies and governments who have shown little knowledge of or regard for the enormous diversity and importance of marine ecosystems In many instances that has resulted in unprecedented environmental damage In other cases the survival of certain species is now balanced on a knife edge P It is high time for the EU to intervene decisively in order to protect our marine environment Therefore we should all fully support these two welcome reports in the hope that the implementation of the necessary strategies and directives will be forthcoming unhindered as well as extended to third countries and that further complementary measures will be introduced in the near future After all the protection of our marine environment is an essential element in safeguarding our own survival on this planet NL Mr President first of all my heartfelt compliments to Mrs Lienemann who really has written an excellent report Ladies and gentlemen it is not easy for fish to survive in the seas and oceans surrounding the European Union overfishing and pollution have taken their toll and when the fish are gone they are gone so we must take drastic measures now in order to prevent the situation arising around 2040 of there being no fish left Let this prediction by scientists serve as an important warning P Whilst the marine strategy is a sound initiative the directive is not specific enough for my liking First of all fish reserves need to be set up By setting up reserves at spawning locations fish are given the opportunity of reproducing at their leisure This has proved effective in New Zealand and Australia If alongside reserves sustainable fishing methods are introduced then we can safeguard the future of fish in the waters surrounding the European Union P In addition something needs to be done about exotic species and the problem of ballast water The Japanese oyster has found a pleasant living climate in the North Sea without natural enemies but this oyster is actually thriving too well The purification of ballast water is a simple procedure that must be undertaken across the board The marine directive requires Member States to think about how the marine environment can be improved and how we can cooperate better which is in the interest of us all I warmly support Mrs Lienemanns report and I hope you will all do the same SV Mr President Commissioner it feels good to be back again and I have been able to begin work by reading two constructive reports P We are all of us responsible for ensuring that our seas can survive the stresses to which the marine environment is exposed An additionally large responsibility lies with this Assembly and the European Union to find the right forms of coordinated and vigorous crossborder cooperation As many speakers have pointed out time is extremely short P In my own part of Europe the Baltic is the most important sea and the one that has been and still is exposed to the greatest threats That is why we view the planned gas pipeline from Russia to Germany with great concern Tomorrow more detailed plans are to be presented A gas pipeline in the sensitive Baltic Sea constitutes a considerable threat to the environment The gas pipeline may be damaged by ships or old unrecovered mines and be exposed to terrorist attack The gas pipeline would constitute a threat to the environment and to fishing both when it was being constructed and during the period that it was in operation In my opinion the risks are manifestly greater than the advantages Certainly Europe needs energy supplies but this natural gas pipeline must not be laid on the bed of the Baltic Sea If the pipeline is to be constructed it must be so on land for the sake of the marine environment and of the Baltic Member of the Commission CS Ladies and gentlemen I have followed your debate with interest and I am pleased to note that in principle you have endorsed the holistic approach favoured by the Commission On the other hand it is clear that this issue is a complex one requiring urgent action in many areas It is also clear that a range of different opinions has emerged and that further analysis and clarification are required P I should like to refer to some of the main amendments in more detail P In the timetable for implementation Amendments 20 24 31 32 35 and 69 the Commission chose the year 2021 as the date by which the Member States have to achieve good environmental status of their marine environments The Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety proposed an earlier date P Although the Commission would like good environmental status to be achieved quickly the committees date is not in my view a realistic one The Commissions proposal addresses firstly the need to improve our understanding of the marine environment and the threats it faces and secondly the need for action In order that we may find the most appropriate and costeffective measures to protect the marine environment we must equip ourselves with the essential knowledge and skills Under these conditions to bring the deadlines forward would be counterproductive P This is clear especially in view of the parallels with the current Water Framework Directive to which this directive is closely related In the Water Framework Directive successfully adopted in 2000 due to the fact that Mrs Lienemann was the rapporteur good environmental status is called for by 2015 that is to say 15 years after the adoption of the directive The Marine Directive should operate in the same way P In view of the extent of the sea area addressed by the Marine Strategy Directive and in view of the size of the task no one should be in any doubt that our proposed timetable is highly ambitious The date proposed by the Commission in the directive 2021 will moreover coincide with the first review of the River Basin Management Plans under the EU Water Framework Directive allowing synergies on the further implementation of both directives P Apart from this the Commission believes that it would not be practical to call on the Member States to achieve good environmental status by 2021 as the Committee on the Environment is proposing in the Directive Nor would it be realistic The measures that must be taken as part of the Marine Strategy will be up and running by 2018 according to the proposed timetable Some measures will not deliver immediate results because it will take time for some of the ecosystems to react to the measures Overall progress towards good environmental status must be shown however which is why the Commission has proposed the idea of achieving good environmental status P The Commission is prepared to support the insertion of an article stressing the importance of marine protected areas Amendments 27 39 62 and 72 Such an article should ideally be based on Article 6 of the Water Framework Directive on protected areas P The Commission is also prepared to back the idea that in order to meet the objectives of the Directive it may be necessary to create further protected areas or even closed nature reserves It cannot accept however the proposal from the Committee on the Environment for the mandatory creation of marine protected areas as part of the implementation of the proposed Directive Protected marine areas should be created only when they can contribute directly towards achieving a good environmental status They should not simply be created as an end in themselves but should be viewed as a means rather than an end P The Commission agrees with the committees wish to integrate the fundamental definition of good environmental status Amendment 80 directly into the Directive P The Commission nevertheless has definite problems with the list of definitions proposed by the Committee on the Environment Many of these definitions are based on the factors influencing the marine environment and the threats to it rather than the quality of the ecosystem This is a dangerous approach because some potential risks and threats may be omitted or on the other side of the coin unduly emphasised Even more importantly if we monitor only the influencing factors the EU will not be able to move away from the current fragmented approach on managing the marine environment towards a more integrated approach which would cover all of the factors as well as their mutual impact on the marine environment P Lastly with regard to financial matters Amendments 19 and 74 there are a number of EU funding mechanisms from which the Member States can benefit for example the Structural Funds LIFE and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research Consequently it is not necessary to create any special funding mechanisms P Honourable Members the debate has touched on the complexity of this whole issue including the fact that the marine environment receives pollution from the atmosphere and that the quality of the marine environment depends to a large extent on tackling climate change It has also been mentioned that some seas have not been included as in the case of the Black Sea and naturally the approach adopted by Romania and Bulgaria will fundamentally change the situation and open up fresh possibilities As regards the Arctic Ocean owing to its geographical situation it is not possible to change the Commissions position significantly and nor is it possible to create an independent strategy for what is an exceptionally sensitive and important environment here albeit in no way connected directly to EU territory P Mr President honourable Members I shall pass on the list of Commission opinions on the Amendments to Parliaments Services The debate is closed P The vote will take place tomorrow at 1130 am P Written Statements Rule 142 SV It is very gratifying that attention is being devoted to issues concerning the marine environment because there is a great need to ensure that our seas do not suffer still more pollution or destruction The amendments by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety are for the most part positive and will hopefully improve the condition of the marine environment especially as a result of good environmental status being defined P The Commissions proposal does however contain an article that gives rise to a certain amount of concern Article 13 on special areas opens up opportunities for to some extent disregarding the environmental objectives if the alterations in a particular area have taken place as a result of actions taken for reasons of great public interest One can imagine this article being invoked very extensively It is therefore extremely important that the Commission impose significant restrictions if and when this happens because the future environment we are all to live in is also of great public interest IT Europe is surrounded by four seas and two oceans containing different types of ecosystems and different biogeographical regions The European coast extends over 100 000 km and is where 16 of Europeans live many of whom are strongly tied to the sea for their work leisure or sport or because of the natural resources and energy it provides In the case of enclosed or partly enclosed seas such as the Black Sea the Baltic and the Mediterranean the risk of pollution is particularly high P The proposal for a Marine Strategy Directive which seems desirable and longawaited must enable the current political framework for the protection of the marine environment in Europe to be expanded and strengthened Its effectiveness will determine the future health of European seas and has the necessary potential to guarantee the environmental basis needed for the sustainable use of the resources and functions of the sea both within and outside of Europe",

Jeggle Albert Jan Maat Mairead McGuinness Francisco José Millán Mon James Nicholson Neil Parish and Daniel Varela SuanzesCarpegna on behalf of the PPEDE Group B604442006 author PT Mr President Commissioner I should first like to thank the political group and the other groups for the interest that they have shown in this subject and that made it possible for this oral question to be put quickly onto the agenda This level of interest is indicative of the importance and sensitivity of the issue of milk quotas P Commissioner you suggested at the informal Council meeting that the system of milk quotas appears increasingly outdated and that it should be questioned and examined in such a way that farmers can plan their lives over the long term On 3 October at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development Mr Rasmussen representing the Commission confirmed that we would see changes following the CAP 20082009 health check most probably a phasing out of the milk quota system before 2015 when the 2003 Agreement is due to expire It was not Parliament that raised this issue now but it is in Parliament that the issue must be clarified because our voters are most concerned and are anxious to know what is going on P The truth of the matter is that the market reacted to these statements immediately and various organisations and political agents appeared in public to have their say on the future of milk quotas Although the CAP health check cannot be viewed as a midterm review we are aware of the internal and external pressures to make changes that go beyond merely simplifying the processes In the dairy sector planning is done over the long term As regards on the one hand quota acquisition and on the other hand genetic improvement environmental obligations and investment in determining the quality of the milk fat and protein content produced by each cow per lactation analysis is required every six to eight years Accordingly what politicians are saying today will have repercussions until 20142015 P As I come from a region in the Azores which accounts for 30 of Portuguese milk production where milk is the main source of income and where there are no mediumterm alternatives I am particularly sensitive to these changes It is therefore essential that we know whether or not the agreement must be complied with and whether any stringent mechanisms are to be put in place before or after 2015 P On the other hand it is also crucial to state for political purposes that the EU will take into account the social and economic impact that changes of this nature could have on regions that depend on milk and in particular on regions in which there are no production alternatives What we really need to know now Commissioner is whether the milk quota system will be maintained in its current form until 2015 so that the market and the producers can be kept fully informed Member of the Commission Mr President for the time being the quota system provides some kind of stability for the European market allowing successful full implementation of the 2003 reform without undue disturbances However if the milk sector is to meet the challenge of competitiveness in the future and prosper in a more liberal world the milk quota system will gradually become a less adequate instrument for achieving our goals I have therefore decided that a debate on the future of the quota system should take place within the health check process in 2008 P The most promising longterm scenario for the European dairy sector is one without quotas This would allow the more efficient producers to benefit from growing markets while avoiding the huge cost especially for young farmers of obtaining production rights The value of the quota system varies tremendously between the Member States Quota levels per Member State are fixed until 31 March 2015 as Mr Freitas rightly said After that date in the absence of a proposal from the Commission and a decision taken in the Council the system of milk quotas will end That is important If no decision is taken the system will expire on 31 March 2015 Were the Council to take a decision to continue the quota system after 2015 this should allow for a gradual transition from the current rules to a scenario without production limits P It is in everybodys interest to have a soft landing in order to avoid disturbances to the sector When I travel around the Member States and talk to farmers they ask for predictability We owe it to the farming sector to give them a clear signal and not a lastminute one on 1 January 2015 as to whether the quota system is to continue or not We need to provide this predictability and in this scenario specific measures should perhaps be introduced during a transitional period in order to make the milk quota system much more flexible than it is today P However it is still too early to take the appropriate measures We will all have a much clearer idea of the situation and of the different options for change once the dairy market outlook report is completed at the end of next year That report will be presented to Parliament and the Council and will look at the overall objectives and results of the 2003 reform namely market orientation competitiveness and the sustainability of the CAP in political environmental and economic and budgetary terms P I hope we can have a solid discussion on the future and on how to provide this predictability which I consider so important not just for the younger generation but also for those already in business on behalf of the PPEDE Group DE Mr President Commissioner many thanks to you for what you have said but I also want to extend warm thanks to my colleague Mr Freitas for taking the initiative and putting this oral question As you have already and repeatedly pointed out Commissioner the current state of affairs that is to say the decision to retain the quota until 31 March 2015 and the question as to what will succeed it is a cause of vigorous debate particularly in certain regions that are or believe themselves to be dependent on milk and on the quotas P It is good to hear a clear statement from you as we indeed just have done in which you give us the facts namely that the quota has been agreed on up to this point and also tell us that we should have a debate in good time on what we propose to do about the situation If we want to carry on having a quota then the farmers must be aware of that and supportive of it exactly in the same way as they have to be of the decision to abandon the system as is in fact currently being envisaged P The question then arises as to what instruments might be feasible in the current financial situation as a means of preparing for its abandonment it may well be for example that an increase in the milk quota is under discussion but I would venture to express doubt as to whether this is the right way of going about it How are we dealing with the option for young farmers who need the security to plan ahead and who very probably ought not to be investing a great deal more money in quotas but rather in restructuring for the sake of their own competitiveness P How too are we to deal with areas that are nothing more than green spaces and need dairy farming if they are to be maintained as such These are in the main areas with very beautiful and very interesting landscape in which there are as a rule very few other ways available of earning a living and so we must support them in this way on behalf of the PSE Group EL Mr President I should like on behalf of my political group to thank the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats and Mr Freitas for his reflections on the question of the Commission statements on milk quotas P Commissioner I shall not refer to what we all know to be the importance of the milk sector in Europe at the level of production employment investments foreign trade or food security However I would point out that any proposal to abolish or keep milk quotas must be studied promptly and carefully and an analysis must be made of its repercussions firstly on rural incomes and the other sectors acutely affected and on rural development itself This analysis should include all the regions of the Union as well as the peculiarities of milk production in some of them P Commissioner we cannot be in favour of controlling milk production after 2015 under the current preconditions which often create oligopolies in the sector It is a production model of the previous common agricultural policy philosophy On the other hand however we cannot accept the liberalisation of milk production quotas from one day to the next before 2015 In this transitional period which we are going through it is necessary to strengthen measures of transparency efficacy and competitiveness of the sector in certain regions of the Community Nor can we announce any review of any product within the framework of the health check in 20082009 If we want to believe that it is a health check what we have is a simplification of the common agricultural policy P I would like to put one question to you is there any possibility of unbundling subsidies in 2007 How can this be combined with the liberalisation or maintenance of the quota system P Commissioner I know that you will submit an honest proposal as regards the limits so as not to give rise to any insecurity among producers I think that you have this political commitment but above all it is the question of timely consultation with the European Parliament that will give competitiveness and a clear orientation to the sector on behalf of the ALDE Group NL Mr President I too should like to start by thanking Mr Freitas for taking the initiative and raising this important topic this evening P When talking about the milk quota it is important to note that the situation when this quota was introduced back in 1984 was completely different from now In 1984 there were large surpluses that could not be sold and that is clearly no longer the case The difference between the global market prices in 1984 and the price in the European Union was enormous but it is now considerably less pronounced P If EU prices approximate to those on the global market there is far less reason to have a quota system than there was in 1984 I am in complete agreement with the Commissioners statement a moment ago to the effect that it is important for farmers to know where they stand I do not know when the Commission will be able to indicate the proposals or direction in detail but it would be ideal in the framework of the health check to also address all other components of agricultural policy and also to hear the Commissions view on the quota system P The situation in the European Union is not as somebody has already mentioned the same everywhere When the Commission presents this analysis it is important that this is done on a countrybycountry and perhaps even regionbyregion basis For some regions it is important that a quota system remains in place Would the Commission address this aspect during the analysis Whatever the outcome on the basis of current knowledge I think it would be preferable to phase out the quota system over a period of time After all if we compare the EUs presence in terms of dairy products within the global market today to that in 1984 the situation is now considerably worse and that is much to be regretted on behalf of the GUENGL Group PT Mr President the Commissioners position on the milk quota system is most worrying in that she is suggesting that they might be dismantled by 2015 P Although she says that it is too early to take substantive measures the path to liberalisation to which she refers overlooks the importance of milk production in various disadvantaged farming areas For example in Portugal both in the North and Central Regions of the mainland and in the Autonomous Region of the Azores any dismantling of the milk quota system would hinder rural development and would impoverish vast areas in which the production of milk and other dairy production is the main activity P We therefore emphasise the need to protect the specific characteristics of farming in various Member States and in particular in Portugal on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President I would like to thank the author of the question for initiating this greatly needed debate on dairy quotas The problems associated with these quotas are a concern for farmers throughout Europe I would like to make the point that if these quotas are to be maintained for a longer period it raises the obvious question of how high they should be because the sizes of milk quotas are blatantly unjust I can cite many examples of how they do not conform to market demand in particular Member States There are countries which are greatly damaged by quotas not being in line with their demand as consumers Examples are Italy and Spain while Poland a new Member State is definitely another one For that reason if the quotas need to be retained then the size of these quotas must be reviewed for the sake of fairness and European solidarity on behalf of the INDDEM Group Mr President since we are on the subject of milk quotas I want to bring a serious situation to the Commissioners attention The Irish milk quota sellers group whose members are all older farmers all hold milk quotas which they wish to sell Their decision to sell the quotas is based on illness infirmity or old age P The Irish Minister for Agriculture has stipulated that she will prioritise in favour of young farmers European law prohibits discrimination on the grounds of age yet our Minister is openly discriminating against older quota owners in favour of young farmers to whom she wishes to give quota and this is the key at below market value She proposes to take the cost out of present quota owners pockets This is interfering with the market Many of these older farmers are at present subject to scaremongering with inaccurate information from their cooperatives P The Minister intends to confiscate quotas not offered for sale on two bases if the quota owner does not produce for two consecutive years or if the quota owner has a leasing arrangement which expires in March one year and he does not sell his quota by the end of March the following year P Minister Coughlan appears to want to divide the traditionally cohesive farming community by the exploitation of one group by another The threat to confiscate quota is an attempt to pressure farmers into poor arrangements and to sell against their will I ask the Commissioner to clarify this situation NL Mr President I should like to thank Mr Freitas for the way in which he has presented the European Christian Democrats initiative and the Commissioner for opening the debate on the future of dairy products Let us be honest the situation has changed over the years high quota costs have caused the cost of milking to soar while European dairy policy is increasingly becoming snarled up We have now lost 60 of our exports within the global market and the European Union and the European dairy sector have lost 4 of world production P Since current demand for dairy products by far outstrips production globally Europe would do well to face the facts and ponder the question what to do after 2015 On the one hand there are the entrepreneurs who would like to grow but are crippled by the high quota costs On the other hand there are areas in Europe where the quotas are currently no longer being achieved the United Kingdom being a case in point There is therefore every reason to look at how we can come up with a good timetable after 2015 in order to attain a better and effective system I should like to make a few suggestions in this respect P First of all milk quotas must become tradable internationally The superlevy must be lowered when the quota is being used but when sales are done with virtually no support to the European Union We could also consider levelling the milk quota at European level When one country does not manage to fill the entire quota and another country could do with some more we could quite simply even the matter out afterwards A gradual quota increase for dairy farmers and cooperatives who sell their products without European support is also conceivable P Finally we advocate an effective use of European funds for rural development in those areas where small dairy farmers face problems in terms of employment and conversion In that way the Commissioner may well be able to use a good timetable that leads to a more marketoriented focus and as a member of the Dutch Christian Democratic party the CDA I would very much welcome it if the Commissioner were to adopt this line I have to congratulate her also because a number of these proposals have already been expressed by Mr Rasmussen Head of Section for Milk and Animal Products in DG Agriculture This bodes well for the future in terms of a timely debate on dairy products ES Mr President Commissioner the midterm reform of the CAP was announced as simply an intermediary review but despite this it has been one of the most significant reforms that the policy has undergone since it began P Given this history and the public statements that you have been making regarding the quota system in recent months that have generated a significant amount of alarm and uncertainty in the sector I would like you to make it perfectly clear that the checkup planned for 2008 will assure us that the reform is working and that under no circumstances does the Commission intend to go further or move forward to the date with regard to which Parliament gave its opinion in the debates on the last reform I would like to remind you that it was in favour of extending the current rules to the 20142015 financial year in accordance with the Commissions proposal Other colleagues have said the same thing P This prospect of stability Commissioner which the Commission proposed at that time remains essential for an economic activity which like any other needs to make plans make investments pay and prepare for what the future may bring with a previously established regulatory framework P In my region Galicia as in others that have been mentioned such as the Autonomous Region of the Azores or Northern Portugal and I would like to thank Mr Freitas whose question made this debate possible farms play a decisive role both in social and environmental terms and also in restoring territorial balance P Agricultural unions maintain that it is the Galician model based on family farms that is the clearest demonstration of the multifunctional role of these types of farm and their capacity to tie people to the region P If the Commission wants to change the rules of the game it should first explain what it plans to do when and how it is going to do it This should all be done with maximum transparency because uncertainty Commissioner is the worst scenario for those working in the sector P The sector needs stability and not shocks time to adapt itself and to plan and I therefore think that we should finish applying the current reform before thinking about the next one FI Mr President milk production is a typical feature of the worst off farming regions It has provided a livelihood and has been a vital force in regions where other areas of agricultural production would be difficult or impossible It has been able to make use of good levels of coarse fodder productivity in areas that are infertile for example P Milk production is capitalintensive The investment needed is massive The modern production structure can cost up to a million euros It only normally creates jobs however for family farms P Milk production is subject to quotas Many young farmers have made huge investments in acquiring additional production rights It is not uncommon for production quotas to be bought for EUR 150 000 or more Milk production therefore needs a longterm protected framework That cannot be seen as an eightyear goal What is a sound system has resulted in a balanced framework for the farmer in which to engage in production Price fluctuations have been small and the market stable P Abolishing milk quotas would alter the situation immediately The large industrial concerns in Europes best regions would be in a strong competitive position Agricultural diversity would be all the poorer Massive investments in milk quotas by family farms would immediately lose their value The milk markets would lose their stability All this would make the enterprise a very risky one and would have an adverse effect in particular on farming regions that are worse off in terms of their prevailing natural conditions PL Mr President the common agricultural policy has raised many doubts and will continue to do so It will always have its supporters and its opponents P The European Commissions intention to review the common agricultural policy and with it milk quotas has raised concerns as well as hope especially in the countries that suffer from it including Poland The quota allocated to Poland was insultingly low A case in point is Germany which has 80 million inhabitants and has a quota of around 28 million tonnes while Poland which has half the population is only allowed some 9 million tonnes of milk In practical terms that means Poland has a quota four and a half million tonnes less than the thirteen to thirteen and a half million tonnes it should be allowed P The question we would therefore like to ask is what would happen if milk quotas were abolished particularly in countries such as Poland where familyowned farmsteads rather than big farms predominate Would the change to the rules of the common agricultural policy not force these farms into bankruptcy PL Mr President Commissioner to me it is highly regrettable that the new Member States benefit the least from the common agricultural policy They are participating in this Marshall Plan for agriculture whose great virtue used to be its longterm focus and vision Well we joined the European Union late This is not the Commissioners fault such is the history of Europe But unfortunately Polish farmers are still grappling with the milk quotas which are several million tonnes too low and in the meantime we pay fines for overproduction of milk when they are to be lifted in 2015 Unfortunately during that time many Polish milk producers will disappear from the market ES Mr President Commissioner as a representative of Galicia a milkproducing region par excellence I think that this oral question put to the European Commission today is very opportune P Commissioner producers are quite disconcerted by information that has been circulated from which it can be deduced that there will be changes to the system established in 2003 for the milk sector and specifically concerning the quota system P You were not very specific today Commissioner but I think that you made a series of things clear that you are going to launch a debate that there is going to be a transition period prior to the removal of quotas in 2015 from which I deduce that there is going to be a phasing out period prior to 2015 when quotas are permanently removed P Commissioner we are talking about an economic sector that needs legal security and medium and longterm guarantees that will enable a minimum degree of planning and any further change or uncertainty could at least in my country have serious social and economic consequences P Quotas are a very important asset to farmers In a region like Galicia in which there is a need to continue with the restructuring process it is essential in order to complete it that the current quota system is maintained as planned If not the consequences could be catastrophic as removing quotas would have drastic repercussions for the price of milk and consequently for profits in the dairy sector P I therefore ask Commissioner that any transitions be made and ideas proposed from 2015 onwards P Finally I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the fact that the policies of the Member States need to cooperate in the whole of this process and that therefore any restriction on exchanges of quotas in a Member State should be considered as a serious obstacle to the capitalisation competitiveness and development of the sector as is unfortunately the case with the national plan proposed by the Spanish Government PT I should once again like to thank you for being in the Chamber Commissioner Your frequent attendance in Strasbourg is ample demonstration of the continued importance of farming in Europe P We have been considering the common agricultural policy My group the Socialist Group in the European Parliament held an important seminar just last week in Brussels on the theme of the CAP as it is and of the CAP as we would like it to be Reflection on the future does not necessarily mean introducing any element of instability Farmers work with nature and value natures cycles and markets as we know react to all elements of instability That being said instability does at least rule out inertia and we must not therefore fall into the old trap of defending the status quo simply for the sake of it P Commissioner the latest statements coming from some quarters have then given rise to extraordinary alarm in the sector to which an appropriate political response needs to be given so that the instability felt by the sector on this matter is not in some cases exploited in the service of untoward political objectives Instability and insecurity can only be tackled by providing regular transparent information that is as clear as possible P I would therefore call on you to adopt as effective as possible a strategy of clarification for the sector and also to make it clear to the sector that the Commission honours its agreements and the arrangements fixed until 2014 These arrangements must naturally be fulfilled without prejudice to the debate and without prejudice to the examination of alternative arrangements that may prove appropriate Mr President Commissioner the ability to have a clear and certain future is very important for any business none more so than for dairy farmers and for the dairy industry Quotas are in place until 2015 and this I believe was a good decision during the midterm review But to now cast doubt on this on the part of the Commission sends the wrong message and I am pleased that the Commissioner went some way tonight to assure us of what the Commissions position is P Commissioner you said that quotas have outlived their usefulness Well OK you may be right but I have to say to you that 2015 is a long time away and it is very difficult to crystalball gaze and see what conditions will be like at that time In 2015 you rightly say we should have a soft landing and when the time comes for quotas to disappear I think that soft landing should come into place What I question is the timing So far from the date by all means let us have an exchange of views on what may or may not happen but how do we encourage our young people to go into the industry How do we take young farmers into the industry How do they plan for the future if the future is being questioned at this moment in time P The dairy sector as you know only too well is the backbone of the agricultural industry throughout the European Union We must work together to achieve a sound future for that industry Only by working together can we achieve that sound future I hope that you will take the opportunity to engage with us in the Committee on Agriculture and positively and actively be involved in ensuring that there is a future for the dairy sector for dairy farmers and for the dairy industry It is not only the people who are employed on the farms who are important the people who are employed in the processing industries and off the farms are equally important ES Mr President Commissioner we all agree that the European countryside and European farmers and livestock breeders need some certainty The Brussels Agreement in 2002 provided that certainty and in exchange for it the Member States tolerated a reform of the CAP that required serious sacrifices for the rural world especially for the cohesion countries P This certainty meant among other things that the system of milk quotas would remain in force until 2015 allowing farmers sufficient time to reorganise their farms in order to make them more competitive and if necessary to leave the sector P But we want the certainties to be maintained and you know that quotas are the only guarantee for farmers in a market in which prices are falling And quotas are an asset for farmers who need to have the freedom to transfer and sell them when they want to cease production What uncertainty does Commissioner is reduce the value of quotas P In my region Asturias 94 000 tonnes have been lost in two years due to farmers giving up Between 1996 and 2006 the number of farms has dropped from 30 000 to just 3 200 Young farmers who we all talk about so much including young farmers with high milk quotas and profitable farms are leaving the sector The Government has also forbidden transfers of quotas between individuals P Our problem Commissioner is rural development You are going to do a health check on the common agricultural policy next year We hope that you will be acting as a doctor and not as a forensic scientist P Do you think it is right to talk about transitional measures when there is not even sufficient funding secured for rural development I would like to remind you that for example my country is going to lose 50 of rural development funds in the next few years Are you planning to report this situation during the review that you carry out next year PL Mr President the debate in this House on dairy quotas is intensifying We are all wondering what will happen if we end the quota system for milk production There has been a great deal of criticism which focuses on the fact that the current system is an archaic one which inhibits the development of the dairy sector and makes it less competitive on the world market P Ending the system is opposed by the countries which have unfavourable natural conditions for dairy production To them ending the system will mean that production will shift to other regions leading to loss of livelihoods and stable incomes for many farmers This may also affect the least developed regions in the east of Poland Poland being one of the countries that was allocated an unfair extremely low milk quota We may soon become net importers P According to some experts the negative impact of a rigid quota system will be worse for Poland than for other Member States because all the system does is restrict opportunities for modernisation and utilising production potential because of the low level of aid for the milk sector in the European Union Many people assert that the milk quotas have lost their economic raison detre We are also in negotiations with the WTO in which we have promised to eliminate export subsidies and greatly reduce the tariffs set up to protect the internal market P How will this affect the EU milk market It appears that limiting the restrictiveness of the system for instance by combining wholesale and direct quotas and restricting the penalties for exceeding the limits would be fair at this moment I would like to remind the Commissioner that there are some countries which are not currently using their quotas to the full Mr President in Ireland they speak of little else I spoke to a large group of dairy farmers in Navan County Meath on Thursday night and the question they are asking is not so much if quotas will be gone in 2015 but what is going to be done from 2008 to collapse the value of the milk quota P I am indebted to last Thursdays edition of the Farmers Journal for outlining five key points that the Commission has in mind It is well worth bringing them to the attention of the House I believe you are looking at gradually increasing quotas from the health check onwards reducing superlevy costs to Member States balancing quotas across the European Union so that an overquota in one Member State may be taken up by slack in another Crossborder trading is on the table as is reducing the value of quotas in Member States That is already happening certainly in Ireland P There is a downside to all of this Every single study that I have read on the subject says that the abolition of milk quotas will lead to a substantial drop in milk prices in many Member States and there will be a corresponding increase in production That would happen in Ireland the Netherlands Denmark and Luxembourg P The key to all this is that we are all for abolition if markets are positive in 2015 but none of us knows what the markets will be like at that time I look forward to your analysis of the dairy market It will have to take a very close look at the future because if global markets are not positive I cannot recommend to farmers that they run faster to stand still It makes no sense P To those who have concerns about young farmers and I have many myself although my little farmers are quite small at the moment who would encourage anyone to go into a business where they have to work twice as hard to earn half as much money It does not make sense We need to bear that in mind P The key is the WTO and what happens there But at least we are having a debate and that is a positive sign We should discuss these things more in this House rather than reading about them in our national newspapers Mr President I wish to thank Mr Freitas for bringing this forward and the Commissioner for being here tonight because this debate is really worthwhile P We have to face up to the fact that as milk quotas and setaside do not fit easily into a decoupled agricultural policy they will have to be phased out in the future We must also set a date and stick to it because ever since I have been here quotas have been about to be phased out and it has never happened We must face the reality that one day they actually will go Everyone in this House accepts the value of dairy production to all our Member States nowhere more so than in my own region of the UK the West Country where dairying is the bread and butter of the whole area but is also under huge pressure What is interesting about quota and the value of quota is that ten years ago in the United Kingdom the rate was nearly a pound a litre whereas now it is worth a penny a litre We must therefore remember that in many ways quota is not a tangible substance and its value can disappear overnight We have to be very careful about how we deal with this In the UK it is the power of the supermarkets and the drivingdown of prices which is now the real problem We are not even meeting our national quota which shows there is a problem with price P At certain points over the last 20 years there has been a world increase in dairy trade but because in Europe control is exercised over the amounts produced it has never been able to take advantage of this We therefore need to have a more flexible regime in the future I should like to hear the Commissioners views on that P New Zealand which probably produces milk as effectively as anybody still has a form of quota because it has a national cooperative of which farmers have to be shareholders in order to be able produce extra milk It is interesting to explore the arrangements beyond 2015 but first we must face up to the reality that quotas need to go author PT Mr President thank you very much As author of the question I should very quickly like to ask the Commissioner a specific question so that we can all leave the House with this issue clearer in our minds P We know as the Commissioner said that if nothing is done the arrangements will end in 2005 We also know that in the view of the Commissioner herself this is an outdated system that must be brought to an end What we want to know now and this is the question that I should like to ask you Commissioner and that I want you to answer very very clearly is whether you accept that phasing out can begin before 2015 as Mr Rasmussen your representative in Parliaments Committee on Agriculture assumed it could or whether the process will begin from 2015 onwards This is a crucial question to which I should like you to give me a very clear answer Member of the Commission Mr President I have listened with great interest to this interesting and very passionate debate It reflects perfectly the importance of the dairy sector P As Mr Mulder rightly said the quota system was introduced in 1984 at a time when we wanted to maintain high prices for our products At that stage therefore the quota system was a good idea However things have changed dramatically over the last 20 years and there was therefore a discussion as part of the 2003 reform on what to do with the dairy sector The decision was taken to maintain the quota system until 31 March 2015 It was decided to increase quotas and reduce prices The phasingin of these changes will be finalised next year P Then there was the possibility of this health check There is not going to be a new reform in 20082009 That is important The health check simply provides an opportunity to streamline and simplify the common agricultural policy in line with the 2003 CAP reform P In my dealings with Parliament I always try to play with a very open hand I do not keep my cards close to my chest We need to have a discussion as part of the health check on what we do with the quota system when it expires in 2015 I have no fixed ideas on phasingout but we need to tell the dairy sector whether or not we want to prolong the quota system I am not proposing any changes as the quota system will expire in 2015 if we do not do anything but we must therefore tell the sector whether or not we are sticking to the agreement to abolish the quota system in 2015 If we say nothing farmers all over Europe will assume that this will not happen They will keep their quotas on the basis of these still being worth something after 31 March 2015 only for the Council and Parliament to suddenly decide to abolish them with the value of quotas falling to zero overnight They will be worth absolutely nothing That is not predictability and we must therefore send a clear signal of what the future will be P As I said in my first contribution we will have this dairy market outlook report at the end of next year I have a tradition Mr Nicholson of working closely with Parliament and specifically with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development so at that point we can discuss what is going to happen in order to provide stability and avoid uncertainty for the dairy sector in the European Union The debate is closed P Written statement Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure HU In recent times several reports have been circulating to the effect that the Commission is preparing to reform the organisation of the milk market an important element of which would be the abolition of milk quotas The Commission has not denied these reports This news is unsettling if only because in recent years reform has been undertaken primarily in those sectors in which the system would in any case have ceased to be in force There is no such compelling reason in the case of the milk sector since the regulations for this sector are in force until 2015 and moreover the quota system has been providing the market and producers with adequate stability P Should the quota system be abolished the income of dairy producers would fall across Europe leading to further concentration in the sector Tens of thousands of farmers producing for the local markets would be obliged to stop production As a result those Member States in which conditions are less favourable would see their milk production fall significantly This would oblige several Member States to supply their dairy needs predominantly from imports P Although in Hungary milk production is primarily in the hands of largescale industries and is competitive nevertheless it would not be in the interests of our country either to abolish the quota system Because of current economic difficulties milk consumption is low and Hungary is not able to take advantage of the quotas allocated to it At the same time however we hope that if the economy picks up then consumption will also rise Therefore Hungary would find particularly unacceptable any transformation of the quota system that involved transferring the quotas of Member States that make less use of them to those countries that make greater use of them HU The reason for maintaining the strict milk quota system is that the quotas that are presently in effect allow for a greater volume of milk production than what the EU consumes internally P From 2007 on direct payments to milk producers have to be kept completely separate from production that is payments will be received not by the milk producer but by the one who owns a milk quota during the reference period in the form of a lump sum based on land area P Under current rules the milk quota system will remain in force until 201415 Commissioner Fischer Boel stated that in the context of the review we should look at the question of quotas but she did not give any concrete details P Maintaining the quota system is the sole guarantee of market and price stability Without quotas production would rise significantly and the resulting surpluses would bring down prices which would very easily stifle small producers At the same time without support only the most competitive industries would be able to compete with the pressure from imports or to succeed on the export market P In Hungary milk production is steadily declining due to problems of efficiency in spite of the fact that purchase prices are not falling we are using only around 70 of the Community quota allocated to us Unfortunately in contrast to Western European practice producers here do not own the processing establishments P If the quota system were abolished the proportion of imported products would rise making the problems of competitiveness among Hungarian producers even more evident and the fall in domestic production would probably accelerate For all these reasons I do not support the abolition of the milk quota system",

    "input": "Support for rural development by the EAFRD Voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP debate The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on P the report by Jan Mulder on behalf of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development regarding a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation EC No 16982005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development EAFRD P C602372006 P the report by Lutz Goepel on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the submission relating to the Regulation of the Council establishing the principles for the voluntary modulation of direct payments set out in Regulation EC No 17822003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing specific support schemes for farmers and amending Regulation EC No 12902005 P C602352006 Member of the Commission Mr President before going into the content of the reports I want to thank the rapporteurs Lutz Goepel and Jan Mulder along with the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their efforts in drafting the two reports P I should like to start with Mr Goepels report I have carefully taken note of the Committee on Agricultures position which is to reject the proposal concerning voluntary modulation and call on the Commission to withdraw the proposal P Before addressing some of the reports points I should like to recall why I presented the proposal and what the guiding principle was for the drafting of it P The Commission proposal is a response to a request made by the European Council last December to present a proposal on voluntary modulation Such a modulation was a means to enable Member States to transfer funds from the first pillar of the common agricultural policy into the second pillar in order to reinforce the rural development budget an objective with which most of you would agree P I have expressed my concerns about certain aspects of the Council agreement in particular that it would apply both to direct payments and to marketrelated expenditure as well as the fact that it derogates significantly from the basic rules of rural development expenditure The Commission tries to address those concerns to the greatest extent possible and ensure as much coherence as possible with the rules governing compulsory modulation and rural development spending That is in line with the Commissions declaration on the interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspectives P With regard to some arguments in Mr Goepels report it is said that voluntary modulation would lead to a distortion of competition I do not share that view Both the single farm payment and rural development expenditure are considered as nontrade distorting under the WTO rules P It is claimed that there is no proper impact assessment Firstly in the short time available during the meeting last December that simply was not feasible Secondly it would have encountered methodological difficulties since we have no idea which Member States would apply voluntary modulation and if they did so we have no idea of the percentages they would apply So the proposal does not go against the principles of rural development such as national cofinancing We propose optional cofinancing as a compromise to meet the expectations of the Council P Let me now turn to the Mulder report on the proposed amendments to Regulation EC No 16982005 The text is a legal translation of what was decided last September by the heads of state and government in relation to the socalled capping provision which is common to all structural instruments including the Rural Development Fund and is also reproduced in the general regulation on the structural funds Moreover the text reflects the noncofinancing requirement for an amount of EUR 320 million as part of the Rural Development Fund allocation to Portugal which was also agreed at last Decembers Council meeting P I have taken note of the draftsmans position in particular on cofinancing I agree that the exemption of EUR 320 million for Portugal from the requirement of national cofinancing should be an exception in rural development since cofinancing is a basic rule in rural development It also means coresponsibility for expenditure and it is an essential element of the subsidiarity that is applied in the policy implemented in the various Member States or regions P I look forward to a fruitful discussion on this issue I will respond at the end of the debate rapporteur DE Mr President Commissioner let me take this opportunity to once more express warm thanks to all my fellow Members from all the groups who have supported me in creating a framework worthy of this debate which is of such great importance to this House and to Europes farmers P You Mr President by your wise and astute decision have ensured that Members from all groups will get the chance to speak albeit at a rather later hour Following a decision by the Council which as is so often the case with agriculture debates is notably absent today the Commission submitted a proposal according to which 20 of agricultural direct payments would be shifted from the first pillar of CAP to the second from which they could be spent without mandatory cofunding P That is a concession by the majority on the Council and whether it wishes to or not on the part of the Commission as part of the budget compromise reached in December 2005 The Commissioner has confirmed as much This House has already expressed strong misgivings about this in the interinstitutional agreement on the Financial Perspective When I say that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development firmly rejected this proposal I mean that it did so with only three dissenting votes and its rejection of the draft legislation was indeed unanimous P This is not just about differences of opinion where specific policies are concerned it is also about where Parliament as an institution should stand in the forthcoming debates on the reorientation of the Community budget As part of the Budget compromise all the institutions agreed that all the Communitys outgoings among them the post2013 agricultural expenditure in particular should be subject to review and that this House will play a full part in this process from an early stage P Now though we see the Council adopting through the back door an extensive remodelling of agricultural funding and this House has no option but to kill it off for there was no prior consultation with us Instead the Council has decided to proceed with such an extensive reallocation of resources that there will be such limited scope for debate in 20082009 that serious discussion will scarcely be on the cards This is something that we in this House cannot tolerate if we are to be taken seriously in future and the proposal is moreover questionable in terms of financial policy P What is worthy of note on the agricultural policy side is that there is no impact assessment accompanying the proposal On the contrary the impression is given that a shortterm reduction of 20 in direct payments would not cause farmers any problems Taken together with the cuts resulting from mandatory modulation and those generally expected after the accession of Bulgaria and Romania what this means for those Member States that want to apply this voluntary modulation is a reduction in payments of something like onethird over against what they were in 2003 Far from supporting structural change in agriculture that amounts to a flagrant structural violation that would put the viability of many thousands of farms in rural areas at risk It is generally agreed that what our farmers need is the security to plan ahead P In the absence of any impact assessment on the part of either the Council or the Commission we caused evaluations to be carried out and these confirm not only that there will be massive distortion of competition and illegal discrimination against the farmers concerned but also that modulation does nothing to serve the objects of the Community in rural areas but rather jeopardises them to a considerable degree P To date the Council has offered no response whatever to the legitimate concerns of Europes farmers and there has as yet been no discussion of the potential consequences This sort of behaviour is not at all what we are used to in the European Union and is also quite obviously inappropriate Since moreover the transferred Community funds are not to be spent in accordance with a strategy laid down at Community level we find ourselves in the paradoxical situation in which the renationalisation of agriculture policy is being paid for entirely from Community funds particularly when one considers the way the Council is thinking ahead I would ask you to take a look and see what happens at the next meeting on 14 November this very week P We all want to strengthen rural areas We have put forward proposals for solutions to their financial problems that are worthy of discussion the Böge report is just one of them The Council though preferred not to give these proposals any closer attention so let us not reach out a hand to help it after all that we have done already If there has to be a paradigm shift in agriculture policy then let that happen only after a transparent and open debate in which Parliament too can have a decisive part to play for this proposal is wide of the mark legally in terms of its substance and as policy and solves none of the problems that rural areas have P If we want our contribution to future debates on the valuation of the agricultural budget to be taken at all seriously then we should firmly and forthrightly reject this proposal I hope that the Councils response to the vote in this House will be to embark on a more indepth discussion of the matters at issue My colleagues in the committee and I myself are willing to join them in this but the Council must make a move It has to be said though that it probably does not entertain very high hopes at the present time rapporteur NL Mr President my report has received unanimous approval in this Houses Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development We considered additional aid for rural development in Portugal to be justifiable although this was not of course ideal it did form part of a package of measures nodded through by the Council in December it was not something to which this House during the negotiations on the financial perspectives thought it necessary to make any changes I should like to repeat though that it is not ideal and should remain an exception We have to accept after all that something similar has been agreed on for various other countries as well P I should now like with your permission Mr President to turn to the Goepel report With regard to the financial perspectives which were subsequently approved by this House as a whole the committee made it quite clear that Parliament has suspended its verdict with regard to voluntary modulation It is therefore surprising that the Commission should come up with a proposal so promptly It has actually only followed the Councils orders for want of a better word P I disagree with the Commissioner that there is no danger of a renationalisation of European agricultural policy it is something I regard as a very dangerous trend What matters most of all to the European farmer is the common market of soon to be 500 million consumers who we must try to retain as much as possible In addition as Mr Goepel has already indicated it can hardly be said that there has been any examination of the policys effects It may well be that around 2013 the average farmer in Europe as a result of all manner of measures will need to make do with one third less of what he received in 2004 Is that the reliable authority that the European Union wants to be What are the consequences of this Can farmers survive this measure in certain regions and suchlike We have not received an analysis of it and it would appear to me that the Commission has no choice when the proposal is submitted but to analyse its effects P One of the most important prerogatives of this Parliament upon which Mr Bösch will undoubtedly elaborate is the right to enact the Budget We have approved the financial perspectives which contain precise figures with so much being set aside for this so much for that and among others so much for market measures in the framework of European agricultural policy and so much for rural policy If voluntary modulation were to be implemented it would have an impact on these figures Does that not amount to a change to the financial perspectives I do believe that it does A change to the financial perspectives requires approval by the budgetary authority that being the European Parliament the Commission and the Council I am not at all certain that Parliament will go along with this That is why I will be voting against the Commission proposals on voluntary modulation draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets DE Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I have not been in this House long but I have been here long enough to realise that solid agreement between the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets such as we have here with the rejection of this draft is not that frequent an occurrence P The opinion of the Committee on Budgets does of course concentrate on the issues of relevance to the budget and there are with regard to these sufficient arguments available to justify the firm repudiation of the Commissions proposal The Member States can by way of voluntary modulation unilaterally and without consultation with Parliament increase nonmandatory expenditure on rural development by many billions of euros contrary to the wording and spirit of the interinstitutional agreement P Nor has the Commission adequately thought through the budgetary consequences of a voluntary transfer of this kind It is irresponsible of the Commissioner to declare herself once more to be taking down dictation from the Council and not to have carried out an impact assessment before the proposal was adopted What will be this proposals effects on the common agricultural policy We do not know that any more than she does and yet we are supposed to agree to it well we are not going to Perhaps then exactly the same thing will happen as did with the European aid arrangements for cotton which the ECJ declared null and void at the beginning of September this year there too the considerable economic effects of the reform had been underestimated or insufficiently examined P Moreover the proposal contradicts everything previously laid down concerning modulation since it makes no provision for cofinancing on the part of the Member States What our Heads of Government have come up with in order to fill the hole in the rural budget for which they were responsible is a cheap solution if the Council were really interested in topping up the funds for the second pillar they could quite simply have complied with this Houses demands in respect of the 20072013 Financial Perspective P What we should do with this proposal is reject it and firmly on behalf of the PPEDE Group Mr President according to Government figures the average earnings of farmers in my constituency in Scotland in 2005 were GBP 10 000 or EUR 14 000 This is disastrous it is forcing farmers into bankruptcy They do not have any room for reinvestment in the industry Instead of offering practical help Prime Minister Blair comes up with the startling proposal to slash 20 off farmers singlefarm payments on top of the existing 5 compulsory modulation that already exists and as we have heard from Mr Goepel a further 8 that will be deducted to pay for Bulgaria and Romania P In other words British farmers as Britain appears to be the only Member State really pushing for this voluntary modulation will lose roughly 33 of their subsidy which for many of them is a vital lifeline But worse this naked discrimination against UK farmers will place them at a huge competitive disadvantage to all other farmers in every other Member State in Europe I say to the Commissioner it may be that in the eyes of the WTO this does not amount to trade distortion but in the pockets of farmers it certainly amounts to a catastrophe P I must also protest at the threats being issued by the UK Government which tells us that if we vote against voluntary modulation it will compromise the future of the popular agrienvironment schemes in which many UK farmers have participated This is tantamount to blackmail and coming from a government that has imposed more than 80 stealth taxes from a Chancellor Gordon Brown who has made taxation in the UK higher than Germany or France and now wants us to believe that he needs to slash 25 off our farmers singlefarm payments in order to be able to afford agrienvironment schemes it is an absolute joke I can tell Mr Brown that if he watches the way this House votes on this proposal he will see what we think of his sense of humour Mr President Commissioner we are being called on today to take a stand on a proposal on rural development policy which we consider to be invalid contradictory and dangerous to the future of the CAP itself as well as to our own credibility This is of course a proposal which emerged from a contradictory compromise by the European Council last December P On the other hand however it is worth our emphasising that the Commission proposal tries to improve the outcome of this highhandedness on the part of the European Council towards both the institutions and the Treaty itself P We agree in principle with the Commission proposals for defining the measure on a multiannual basis at national level and retaining the limits which exist in the Rural Development Fund However although these improving proposals could be considered as a good effort by the Commission towards the Council they cannot be considered adequate P As the Socialist Group in the European Parliament we shall vote against the legislative text of the Commission regulation on voluntary modulation at this stage for the following reasons firstly in order to strengthen the Commissions negotiating position with the Council which in essence wants voluntary modulation as a blank cheque for managing Community expenditure under pillars 1 and 2 P Secondly in order to give the Commission the time needed to present an integrated proposal which responds to the real needs and the real rural development support mechanisms without renationalising the CAP P Thirdly in order to provide a time margin for studying the effective and essential possibility of taking up Community resources transferred from compulsory modulation and from the new additional modulation in order to avoid the return of significant resources from the Member States due to inadequate application of the programmes P Commissioner there is already a timetable for evaluating the new CAP and its priorities We expect the Commission to examine measures for viable effective simple and transparent policies which will contribute towards the objectives of rural convergence and development You will find my group in agreement with such a policy A ceiling on payments and an additional single modulation rate are policies with which we can agree in principle However they will have to be clarified as to their expediency their added value and the degree to which they help to achieve the objective of rural convergence P Commissioner only under these preconditions will the Commission be able to submit an integrated proposal so that all together we can save European aspirations and our credibility in the eyes of the citizens of Europe on behalf of the ALDE Group FI Mr President first I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel for their excellent reports Voluntary modulation is a bit of an oddity something which has never been tried before in the EUs common agricultural policy The conclusion adopted by the European Council that a Member State may cut a farmers direct aid and marketing payments by a maximum of 20 was both unexpected and very badly formulated The European Council decided that even export aid could be cut Luckily the Commission did not go along with this totally unrealistic proposal P First of all the cut would not be based on any objective rules but would merely be the result of highhandedness on the part of a Member State It would lead to inequality among farmers and would distort competition It would amount to an arbitrary additional tax on farmers P Secondly it needs to be made very clear that the cut would not increase resources for rural development in the countries concerned This additional funding would not be affected by national cofinancing as contained in the Regulation on rural development A Member State could use modulated cash in place of its own national funding and thus reduce it It would then of course be a case of a direct payment of agricultural aid to the Member States Ministry of Finance How could the European Parliament deal with discharge as regards such a transfer of funds P Voluntary modulation would entail moving funds from the EU budgets compulsory expenditure to noncompulsory expenditure That would mean that the interinsitutional agreement would have to be altered The Council would thus be in violation of that agreement six months after it was concluded The Council would therefore not be a reliable partner in the agreement For these reasons I warmly welcomed Mr Goepels suggestion that Parliament should reject the proposal on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President Commissioner Mr Mulder we are today discussing the second pillar and rural economic development something that this House and if one is to believe its own utterances the Commission too regard as important and even the members of the Council in their speeches keep on emphasising that this is where the future of European agricultural policy lies yet here we are rejecting a proposal that is intended to all outward appearance to put several billions of euros aside for this purpose P It is not easy to justify this rejection on the basis of the money involved but the offer being made to us is an improper one The powers that have caused it to be made are those who are responsible for rural development falling EUR 20 billion short of the budget proposal made by this House and the Commission it is they who have forced through budget cuts come what may not least to the detriment of this qualitative line and are now saying OK you can take 20 per cent out of the first pillar and then use it to top up what we have taken away from you P That is what I call improper These powers are no friends to European agriculture or indeed to Europes rural areas what they are seeking to do instead is to use the agriculture budget as a quarry in the same way as they are trying to do with many other policy areas but what makes this so very deceitful is that it has the appearance of being a redistribution while not really being one with the possibility of taking the money out without cofunding so in other words the agriculture budget is as a whole more likely to lose something than have anything added to it P This is in fact not the proposal that the committee made for mediumterm financial planning in which we said that cofunding in the first pillar too would have made it possible for funds to be made available for the second we would in fact have been able to restrict the cofunding of the second pillar to 25 thus enabling a better flow of funds but all these proposals were cast to the winds and now along they come with this figure of 20 The only thing is Commissioner that this financial plan has been agreed to by the Commission and also and this I have to say with bitter regret by this House which has gone along with this extortion in order not to put the European Unions financial future at risk P Commissioner that must not be allowed to hamper us though and I will ask you just what you propose to do in order that rural development is not starved of funding What are we in this House to do How are we in our groups to make it clear that rural development can have a future not only through the reallocation of funds and that this whole budget line must develop its financial arrangements independently in the same way as the other structural funds have done It is to that question that I would like to have an answer from you here and now in order that the Commission in our next negotiations on this subject should show its colours more openly and that we here in this House might perhaps stand up for ourselves a bit more on behalf of the GUENGL Group PT Mr President I should firstly like to stress the importance of adopting Mr Mulders report thereby giving assent to the Commissions proposal to exempt Portugal from the requirement to cofinance the amount of EUR 320 million in line with the December 2005 Financial Council Agreement P My country Portugal faces known difficulties in meeting the unfair criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact given the fragility of our economy and the accumulating social problems especially in rural areas Hence the importance of adopting this proposal P As regards the Goepel report I wish secondly to say that we are in favour of compulsory modulation accompanied by capping and by the fair redistribution of these funds and in the new Member States too As previous speakers have said this is not guaranteed in this Commission proposal We therefore call on you Commissioner to reconsider your proposal on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President I would like to congratulate Mr Goepel on his excellent report whose views I fully share Although the proposed modulation directly affects the old Member States it is also cause for concern among farmers in the new Member States The modulation impairs the vision of stable agricultural rules until 2013 and will lead to what we fear greatly in the new Member States that is a partial renationalisation of agricultural policy which the new poorer Member States will not be able to afford That is the reason for our concern P Let us adhere to the established agricultural policy rules Keeping them stable until 2013 is the minimum of certainty we owe to our farmers They have been subjected to too many upheavals in a short time changes to the support system liberalisation of agricultural markets and increasingly stringent norms and standards in various fields It is all too much too soon What agriculture needs is clear and stable rules for at least the coming few years That is why I support Mr Goepels report on behalf of the INDDEM Group PL Mr President todays debate on the voluntary modulation of direct payments once again highlights the different ways in which the old and the new Member States understand the common agricultural policy When the old members think of the future of the CAP they think of the future of agriculture in their own countries rather than in the enlarged European Union P Rejecting the Commissions proposal is the most appropriate course of action The claim that it is contrary to the rules of competition and solidarity threatens renationalisations and breaks the promises made to the farmers is correct The point is why were these arguments not considered when setting out the terms of accession for the new Member States in 2004 These conditions have blatantly undermined competition and the principles of solidarity The poorer states who receive much lower payments are forced to compete on unequal terms P Renationalisation of the common agricultural policy was introduced in the new Member States which in 2004 paid as much as 75 to the first pillar while the old fifteen members benefit from 100 EU support This is hypocrisy The terms of accession were not based on objective criteria but discriminatory production quotas were imposed which took no account of the potential of producers and selfsufficiency in food production for example the milk sector Support in the most obvious cases fruit and vegetable growing has been neglected and no consideration has been given to the extremely low income of farmers in the new Member States This mindset is a threat to farmers to consumers and to the entire economy of the European Union PT Mr President Commissioner I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their excellent reports and by saying that I endorse the proposals contained in their reports The Councils decision last December to allow voluntary modulation may lead to distortion of competition between the farmers of different Member States depending on the percentages of modulation that they choose to adopt P The fact that there is soon to be a health check on the CAP 2008 in which we shall be able to discuss capping and the increase in compulsory modulation is a further reason not to press ahead now with measures such as voluntary modulation which may bring irreversible consequences If this proposal is pushed through we shall clearly be taking a further step towards renationalising the CAP and dismantling the communitisation of agricultural policy P Without wishing to underplay the political importance of rural development I must say that investment in this policy will not be boosted by this measure Let me give the example of my country which returns more secondpillar funding to Brussels than any other country and which in the EU15 already had the largest balance between the first and second pillars 53 and 47 respectively P Nevertheless the Minister for Agriculture in my country Portugal has already announced the intention to adopt 20 modulation Taking back money from farmers in order to fund the State budget or so that the money can be given back to Brussels will certainly not be the best solution for farmers and it represents an approach based solely on economic criteria and aimed at using the money for rural development without cofinancing P With these practical risks which are already clearly apparent in countries like Portugal as evidenced by the example I mentioned it is abundantly clear that if we are to defend farmers resolutely and to champion a common agricultural policy we must do all we can to ensure that voluntary modulation goes no further PL Mr President like my colleague before me I would like to express my support for Mr Mulders draft report on exempting Portugal from the requirement to cofinance its national quota of EUR 320 million This is a good decision which shows solidarity and is particularly important in the light of the drought that has hit that country I concur fully with Mrs Batzelis words on Mr Goepels report but as regards Mr Mulders report and in particular the final section where the rapporteur criticises the method by which rural development funds are distributed under the current rules and where he demands that distribution be based on objective criteria I would like to draw your attention to the following facts P The new Member States are characterised by significant underinvestment in the farming sector and their farmers incomes are vastly disproportionate to those in the other Member States They are also ignored as regards the fundamental principles of nondiscrimination solidarity and proportionality and by having to cofinance direct payments from their own budgets which are much smaller not to mention the huge reduction of around EUR 20 billion in the pool of funds for rural development for 20072013 in comparison to what was promised during the accession negotiations P Here I must also point out that support for rural development as set out in the strategic Community guidelines should make allowance for the differing structural problems in the fifteen and the ten EU member states including Bulgaria and Romania Particular attention must be paid to ensuring the necessary funding for the new Member States in respect of their huge need for basic investment and the need to secure wideranging support for rural development P Rural development policy offers a range of mechanisms which make it possible to influence the differing needs of European farmers P However we need to search further for effective mechanisms for such a policy in order for it to fulfil its aims and to make it increasingly effective for all countries of the European Union FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen firstly I too should like to thank our rapporteur Mr Mulder for his steadfast work not only on budgetary issues in general but also on issues concerning the funding of agricultural and rural policies P If in my capacity as permanent rapporteur on the Structural Funds within my committee I asked to take the floor in this debate on the modification of the ceilings on EAFRD development support it was to express two things firstly a democratic regret but also a kind of strategic wish I deeply regret the fact that the European Parliament is being forced to change the ceilings that it has already adopted and this in order to bring them into line with the decisions taken by the Council P Furthermore my strategic wish consists in pointing out our attachment to the fundamental principles of rural development policy and the extent of that attachment because these principles give Europe transparency I should like us to remain very cautious when faced with the temptation to make wider use of obligatory cofinancing which could eventually lead to the renationalisation of expenditure under the first pillar Such a decision must not be the subject of a go with the flow policy but must be considered as an important issue to be subjected to a clear and democratic debate As for the necessary and undoubtedly justifiable Christmas presents given to Portugal on this subject too I regret that there is no real strategy and I would ask that we define one and that it be the outcome of an indepth debate PL Mr President the proposal for socalled voluntary modulation by the Member States as regards direct payments to agriculture will in effect lead to a cut of some 20 in the funds paid out to farmers which will be in breach of the norms and procedures prevailing in the European Union Exempting farms receiving less than EUR 5 000 from modulation means that only farms under 40 hectares will be covered P This system which is on the face of it logical cannot be cohesive merely due to the fact that the new Member States unlike the old countries are already cofinancing the common agricultural policy by topping up EU payments from their own budgets P In my opinion we should aim to eliminate the existing imbalances and introduce new rules and payments in all Member States as quickly as possible Otherwise regional inequalities will intensify I would like to remind this House that it was we Polish MEPs who warned of the consequences of approving an EU budget of just 1 of GNP and cutting rural development funds PL Mr President direct payments give many poor Polish farming families a chance to make ends meet They have been a way of buffering the increased cost of production since Polands accession to the European Union Using voluntary modulation to reduce them by as much as one third from 2008 at a time when they are so low in our country anyway would cause substantial losses to these farms and families P The important aim of developing rural areas to which the money thus saved would be directed should be pursued on the basis of other funds We could restrict regional payments to recipients with a maximum not of 50 but of 100 200 or 500 and more hectares Mr President I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Mulder and Mr Goepel on their reports My first point is that this is an extremely bad proposal We know how it originated in the Council meeting last December I would say to the Commissioner that this is a proposal that will only be implemented in the United Kingdom We all know that Even the dogs in the street know that It has been brought in to help Blair and his government try and resolve their problem P It will place United Kingdom farmers in an impossible position Financially they will be in a totally invidious position compared to other farmers in all parts of the other 24 EU Member States In Northern Ireland it will erode the concept of the family farm which is the backbone of our industry P I therefore totally reject this proposal and will not stand by and allow anyone to hijack farmers single farm payments This was something that was agreed It was promised and it is depended upon It is not the fault of our farmers that the UK Government has negotiated such a miserable deal on development of the second pillar in support of the rural economy I must say to the Commission the Council and the UK Government that they should not blame us if now they do not have sufficient funds to support some of their proposals for the rural and environmental development of the countryside I can take no blame for this It is totally the responsibility of the negotiators P I must also tell the truth which is that the socalled negotiators have achieved the worst possible deal and that they now want to hijack a maximum of 20 or perhaps even 25 of farmers single farm payments Such a proposal must not be agreed to either now or in the future It will turn farmers and other members of rural society against each other It is unworkable and will spell the beginning of the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy as we have known it It must not be accepted P This dossier will have to be referred back to committee and I will call on the Commission not to fall into what is a skilful trap that would set farmers and other rural dwellers at each others throats We have a duty to reject this legislation We must never agree to this covert means of undermining UK farmers and placing them in a position so subservient to the rest of the European Union FR Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen everyone is familiar with the 2003 CAP reform which provided for the freezing of the first pillar and the strengthening of the second namely rural development The fact is that the agreement on the new financial perspective which I might add I voted against runs counter to these two commitments P Indeed the rural development package has lost EUR 20 billion in comparison with the Commission proposal a figure that represents for the 15 old Member States 35 less than the current period The proposal for voluntary additional modulation which is aimed at transferring a maximum of 20 of the sums from the first to the second pillar and which does not meet any of the criteria applicable to rural development policy is unacceptable P I recognise that the European Commission has attempted in its proposal for a regulation to manage this tool but I share the rapporteurs concerns and I endorse his proposal that it be rejected the risk of distorted competition is too great if certain Member States choose to deduct 20 from direct aid and not from other types of aid It is unacceptable for this voluntary modulation not to have to comply with the same rules as those that normally apply to rural development and the risk of the CAP being renationalised is too great P The funding requirements for rural development policy are however real and I fear more people abandoning our rural areas That is why I am calling on the Commission to propose instead of voluntary modulation an identical increase in the rate of compulsory modulation in all of the Member States P I should also like to stress that compulsory modulation currently applies as soon as a farm receives more than EUR 5 000 in agricultural support per year The large majority of farms are indeed affected P If we are to have a genuine tool for redistributing aid we should also take account of other criteria such as the size of the farm its dependence on aid the workforce employed the standard gross margin and so on Furthermore if we are to guarantee that agricultural support is divided up fairly we should think about capping direct aid Mr President I speak on behalf of the UK delegation in my group We fully understand the cogency of the arguments in the Goepel report and the reasons for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Developments voting indications However the approach of successive Westminster governments to EU rural development funding has restricted its availability in the UK Our allocation for 2007 to 2013 is only a quarter of what fairness would in principle require P In default of some further degree of modulation there would be severe constraints on establishing and maintaining effective rural development programmes particularly in relation to the environment There is also a risk of delays in making some of the payments of which farmers have a legitimate expectation P I am grateful to the Commission for its willingness to explore the ways in which it might be possible to overcome such immediate practical problems but that can only be a stopgap We need a much longerterm solution We therefore call on the Commission as a matter of urgency to find a way of redressing the current historical imbalances in the allocation of rural development funding P As a Scot I ask that in any further discussions on modulation both the Commission and colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture take account of the fact that the levels are of concern not only to Member States but to administrations at substate level as well PL Mr President in thanking both of our colleagues for their work I would like to focus more closely on Mr Mulders report We are raising a question that affects the mechanism of funding designated for areas inhabited by some 20 of the population of the European Union but which are very important as regards secure food supplies for Europe P We therefore need to do everything to strengthen the position of rural areas and secure the cohesion that we are supposed to provide The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Regional Development should also serve this purpose This is essential for all countries including my own country Poland Although today we are debating changes to the regulations affecting Portugal which I support we need to stress clearly that this has upset the sequence of things First of all the procedure should be set out and only then the specific financial decisions made P Therefore let us treat this as an exceptional situation and look for systemic solutions which based on as objective and nondiscriminatory criteria as possible will really strengthen European farming Any other course of action may end up by destroying European solidarity in this area PL Mr President in order to keep European agriculture competitive we must maintain the current level of direct farm payments in the old Member States and not introduce the additional modulation of 20 P The arguments put forward by the European Commission are unconvincing while the proposition does not conform to the principles of the CAP The new Member States need more funds for the development of rural areas for reasons which include reducing the labourintensity of farming and to speed up the transfer of land from social and small farms to largescale market farms This will improve the competitiveness of farming in the new Member States mainly through economies of scale P Instead what has been done If you remember the new financial perspective adopted for 20072013 cut the rural development funds by 20 billion euro compared to what was proposed by the Commission We must apply different methods of support because there is a distinction between the countryside and farming in the European Union Rural areas in European Union countries including Poland are poorer than the cities and need more jobs the development of services and better environmental protection For this reason we need to support farmers and the countryside throughout the European Union for many years to come PT I should like to congratulate Mr Mulder on his admirable report and to thank the members of the committee who voted unanimously to adopt the report P The decision to exempt Portugal from cofinancing for the amount of EUR 320 million is a fair one and comes on the back of a number of Council decisions aimed at offsetting the recognised difficulties faced by Portuguese farmers in relation to the CAP as it stands whereby farmers have been manifestly penalised This is a way of compensating them P As for the Goepel report regrettably I am not able to extend the same congratulations because this is an eminently political matter and we must use political arguments to discuss it We all know that the CAP unfairly works against various Member States various regions and many farmers and one way of correcting that injustice is to apply modulation mechanisms P In the case of Portugal this distortion is utterly scandalous just 5 of farmers receive more than EUR 5 000 per year Consequently given that voluntary modulation is possible and that compulsory modulation is currently impossible voluntary modulation is preferable to having no modulation at all P I therefore feel that the positions that have come to light are deeply inappropriate I should like to reassure the Commissioner that she is not alone in defending this position in Parliament I believe that in the interests of justice it is only right that funds be given to the Member States I should like to draw Mr Nicholsons attention to the fact that it is not only the United Kingdom that will apply the measure the Portuguese Government has already announced that it will do so I feel therefore that not allowing the Member States to use this instrument to do the right thing in relation to many farmers who are unable to receive a single cent under the first pillar of the CAP or restricting their ability to do so is a totally inappropriate position for Parliament to take I say this solely on the basis of political arguments because I have neither the time nor the desire to discuss legal technical and other aspects of the issue Mr President I should like to thank Mr Goepel and Mr Mulder for these reports P Commissioner you know very well that your heart is not in this and that you are having to do the Councils bidding This is a complete mess You have a lot of support here in Parliament In fact the Council has managed to unite the whole Parliament against this proposal When we vote tomorrow we will reject it it will go back to committee and we will reject it again So I urge you to come forward with a new proposal P When I first came to the European Parliament my farming friends told me the one thing they wanted out of Europe was a level playing field That may be a forlorn hope but this proposal makes it less level than it has ever been I do not need to tell you Commissioner that the British Government is about to be fined for not meeting the deadline for the Single Farm Payment Scheme So what do you do When it cannot make the payments on time you give it more rural development money to squander You can imagine how much confidence farmers have in the Government to deliver that at the moment P As I look across the House tonight it is interesting that there is not one member of the Labour Party on the Socialist benches Who is here to defend Mr Blairs proposal No one So look to us for help P As Mr Stevenson said the government is putting enormous pressure on us to say that we are against environmental schemes Can I put it clearly on record that we are not and nor is the Commissioner But we need to move forward with more money going from the first to the second pillar all across Europe a compulsory modulation on a level amount Also as other speakers have said there has been no proper impact assessment of this proposal It cannot possibly go forward P The cotton regime was scrapped after a ruling by the European Court of Justice P Please think again and come back with a new proposal HU Mr President the use of the current Community payments when placed alongside the decision of the European Council taken in December 2005 according to which Portugal receives special treatment through an exemption from the cofinancing requirement raises serious questions about the budgetary decisionmaking process P In spite of the fact that there is broad agreement on the exceptional exemption of Portugal from the cofinancing requirement questions and problems of legitimacy may arise in relation to the horse trading methods of negotiation engaged in by the Council P Although I do not oppose this onetime concession offered to Portugal I consider it important that in future no Member State be allowed to benefit from special treatment solely in order to persuade it to support a particular agreement On the contrary equality and transparency are fundamental criteria that should be observed in all circumstances and at every level of negotiation with the Council P In future not only must we prevent these forms of positive discrimination but since we have committed ourselves to an egalitarian agricultural policy then the regulation of rural development should not be permitted to rely on exceptions We need to put an end to all forms of discrimination P I agree with the rapporteur that the system should not make any distinctions or exceptions but that we need a fair standardised approach that distributes resources on the basis of objective criteria However I do not agree with the rapporteur that it would be a good solution to finance the direct payments in the first pillar because although this would lessen pressure on the European budget it would cause serious financing problems for the new Member States which are in a strained budgetary situation because of the convergence programmes necessary for the introduction of the euro As a result this would further increase inequalities among Member States P For the same reason I do not consider voluntary modulation to be the most appropriate solution Apart from respecting current agreements in future we must strive to create a truly united rural policy instead of making further exceptions Mr President I should like to thank both rapporteurs for their reports When I reread the Presidency Conclusions these seven lines of text read worse now than they did almost a year ago It is literally a freeforall for any Member State that wants to take it up and it has no regard for the rules that this House and indeed the Council itself had drawn up in relation to rural development Voluntary modulation as outlined in this proposal is anything but voluntary because the farmers certainly do not want it Therefore we are misusing and abusing words P Of course this proposal distorts It has to because it is allowed in one Member State but it may not be applied in others We need to look at the impact of this on agriculture generally P I am also conscious that we are looking towards a health check for the CAP in 2008 and in parallel with that a review of the financial perspectives P I should like to compliment the Commission on trying to make something good out of what is essentially a very bad proposal the Commission is trying to get rules applied and is insisting that they be implemented it is excluding market support measures P I shall conclude by saying that it is very difficult to make something good out of essentially a poor suggestion or to use an agricultural term you cannot make a silk purse out of a sows ear I compliment the Commission for even trying to do so This is a bad proposal and we will be rejecting it ES Mr President the proposal that we are debating today is unacceptable It is unacceptable because it is disintegratory fragmentary antiEuropean selfish and highly hypocritical P From the point of view of agricultural theory it involves cutting 20 of direct aid to farmers in order to fund rural development and thus fill in holes These holes were created because in the financial perspectives 1 is not sufficient to fund the agricultural policies and as the Member States are incapable of giving more money they have to take it away from those who were receiving it until now P It also represents the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy getting rid of the only truly European policy the only policy that united European producers And not only does it mean renationalisation but if we look at the proposal by the Spanish Government to the Council it means going much further not only renationalising but regionalising This way everyone will be able to do what they want P I think that it is part of the disintegratory madness of the socialist Spanish President who Mr Parish also has no one here to defend him because he along with all the presidents who signed the financial perspectives and accept this change do not care at all about the competitiveness of the European agricultural sector and the impact that these measures may have on their economies is of little importance to them P Therefore and in defence of European farmers and livestock breeders and of the sector we will of course reject this proposal Mr President I apologise for not being in the House when I was first called but my travel arrangements went rather awry today P Voluntary modulation is but fancy phraseology for a very unpleasant practice namely government grab of farmers money As Mrs McGuiness has said there is nothing voluntary about it certainly in respect of those from whom the money is to be extracted namely the farmers P The consequence is a very unbalanced rural development programme right across Europe both in how it is financed and then in how it is delivered That of course is then discriminatory against the farmers in those Member States that practice this madness of voluntary modulation In my country we are already seeing the consequences with delays in the intended LFA payments P Voluntary modulation is something to be resisted I welcome the stance of the committee and the stance of this House when it rejects it and I urge the Commission to be robust in forcing a change of policy by the Council on this matter Member of the Commission Mr President I have listened to the debate carefully and with huge interest I can only repeat what I said at the outset ie that the Commission proposal is consistent with the European Councils request P As Mrs McGuinness rightly said we have tried to align it as much as possible with the existing rules on obligatory modulation and financing of the rural development policy P Tomorrow if or I should say when the European Parliament rejects the Commissions proposal I intend to raise the issue with my fellow Commissioners in order to consider our position carefully That is completely in accordance with the framework agreement between our two institutions Thank you Commissioner that was very clear I thank all those who took part in the debate I should also like to thank all the interpreters P That concludes the joint debate P The vote will be tomorrow",

    "input": "Legislative and work programme of the Commission for 2007 debate The next item is the debate on the legislative and work programme of the Commission for 2007 President of the Commission Mr President honourable Members ladies and gentlemen when the lights went out across Europe last week our interdependence as Europeans was laid bare for all to see In a flash greater integration ceased to be some abstract ideal For millions of our citizens it became a necessity The incident dare I say it was illuminating The argument for more Europe has not so much been won as rendered superfluous It is now clear to everyone that we face more shared challenges than ever before thanks in part to the forces unleashed by globalisation And shared challenges demand shared solutions whether they relate to growth and jobs in an increasingly competitive world climate change energy security or indeed international terrorism P We can be proud of our response so far to this rapidly changing landscape First we renewed the Lisbon Agenda and placed the emphasis squarely on growth and jobs As a result it was possible to restore confidence in the Stability and Growth Pact putting it on a more realistic and workable footing P Europes leaders agreed to put globalisation at the centre of its policy agenda and the Commission has been busy equipping the European Union with the tools it needs and using those tools on a whole range of concerns that European citizens share To boost growth and jobs the European institutions have continued work to unleash the full potential of the single market At the same time we have renewed our commitment to social solidarity including the settingup of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund a useful shock absorber for the powerful motor of globalisation P To ensure that Europe thrives in the knowledge economies of tomorrow innovation became a central part of our economic and social strategies and today innovation is at the core of the concerns of European leaders The establishment of the European Institute of Technology will help reverse the fragmentation of research education and innovation efforts which has stunted progress so far P The document Europe in the World tackles the need to develop a global voice which matches our economic weight in the world This will also reinforce our efforts in areas where we have already exerted leadership notably in the debate on a future international climate change regime P And we have successfully steered Romania and Bulgaria towards European Union membership We have proposed the two new Commissioners and allocated the portfolios One will be responsible for consumer affairs and the other for multilingualism to protect and to reinforce European cultural pluralism and diversity Intercultural aspects are more and more important in the Europe of today I am very proud that this further step Romania and Bulgaria joining the Union has taken place and that my Commission has made an important contribution to it I think we should all be very proud of what has been achieved through successive enlargements Let there be no doubt in centuries to come historians will say that enlargement was the greatest instrument for peace prosperity and stability of our generation P Applause P On that note I would like to say it is more than time we stopped talking about old and new Member States More than ever before we are now one Europe united in all our diversity and that is something we should celebrate P We have also laid the groundwork in many other areas that concern us all sustainable development maritime policy and energy efficiency to name just a few P We still have much to achieve by the end of this year I hope that the European Council will approve the enlargement package we adopted last week We need to move forward on immigration and innovation policy and we still have important proposals to adopt in areas like labour law copyright levies neighbourhood policy CO2 emissions from cars and emissions trading P So the first years of this Commission working in a spirit of partnership with this Parliament have meant renewing reorienting and retooling to create a Europe of results a Europe fit to face the shared challenges of the 21st century These efforts are already bearing fruit growth has been revised upwards to its highest level in six years unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since we started collecting EU25 data in 1998 P Now 2007 the year we celebrate 50 years of European construction will mark a turning point It will mark the moment when a Europe of 27 after careful preparation throws the full weight of the Unions retuned machinery behind the delivery of solutions to our citizens shared concerns It will mark the moment when a new budgetary framework unlocks modernised financing programmes which move towards Europes new agenda P So this is the context for our 2007 Work Programme It is a new type of programme that has greatly benefited from input from this Parliament the Council and the other institutions valuable input that will continue with this debate and the resolution you adopt P This Work Programme addresses many of Parliaments concerns that have been conveyed to me and to the Commission This new Work Programme is more political It is focused on a smaller list of 21 strategic initiatives The Commission is committed to delivering all of these next year and they will not be subject to a midterm review A second list of priority initiatives fills out our work in other important areas P In addition we have responded to calls from Parliament to include a list of simplification measures and withdrawals of legislative proposals in the Work Programme This underlines the message that Better Regulation is now an integral part of the Commissions daytoday tasks Today in the College meeting we adopted our strategic review of Better Regulation that takes stock of progress to date and sets out an ambitious programme of new initiatives This includes new action in the following areas impact assessment where we will establish an Impact Assessment Board simplification where we will add important new initiatives to our rolling programme and administrative burdens where we will suggest a target to the Spring European Council next year to cut such burdens at European Union and Member State levels by 25 by 2012 In parallel we will present an action plan in two months time defining priority areas for action P We are also continuing to screen and in a number of cases withdraw pending proposals We are recommending that future Commissions do the same at the beginning of their mandates as an expression of the changed political composition of a new Commission so showing the importance of political legitimacy and political leadership This review responds to a very large extent to the priorities of the European Parliament as expressed in several reports earlier this year I hope you will give your full endorsement to this package including to its practical implementation P So what does the 2007 Work Programme feature Let me highlight some key areas those I believe to be politically very sensitive P First energy Building on our Green Paper and measures for greater energy efficiency earlier this year we will present the first ever Strategic Energy Review for Europe This will include the building blocks for an integrated European Union energy policy for example measures to complete the internal market for electricity and gas to accelerate takeup of new lowcarbon technologies and to diversify and secure supplies both within and outside Europe The goal is a common European energy policy that will ensure our security of supply while maintaining Europes competitiveness and safeguarding our environmental objectives P Closely linked to this in fact I could say they are two parts of the same agenda will be action on climate change We will put forward options for a European Union climate change policy and perspectives for international cooperation postKyoto A revision of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme will provide greater stability for investments and accelerate the momentum to cut greenhouse gases P Europes demographic squeeze calls for greater efforts to attract economic migrants particularly those who are skilled A European regime for labour immigration will give such migrants a secure legal status while clarifying their obligations and their rights In order to reduce illegal immigration and exploitation of workers this will be coupled with a clampdown on unscrupulous employers of thirdcountry nationals who enter Europe illegally P European public policy can have a fundamental impact on the way people live their lives To be effective it must be properly attuned to the needs of modern society The Commission will undertake a fundamental stocktaking of European society which will serve as a basis for European policymaking into the next decade As I have said several times Europe is more than a market Europe without the concept of solidarity is not really a European Union P Applause P Our core business in terms of our competences under the Treaties will not be forgotten either The Commission will continue to defend extend and modernise the single market A key target for 2007 will be the defence industries and markets which have been fragmented for far too long We will also set out the way forward on services of general interest in the coming weeks P A final area of concern to all our citizens is security The Commission will bring forward additional measures to combat terrorism with a particular focus on fighting terrorist propaganda and the sharing of expertise on explosives for example for terrorist purposes P The year 2007 will also mark a turning point in our search for an institutional settlement The Berlin Declaration marking the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome will allow Europes leaders to renew their commitment to an enlarged global and competitive Europe where solidarity is a central principle I believe it should be a short sharp political declaration affirming what unites us and above all making clear where we want to go and what we want Europe to be for the next 50 years Following my initial proposal I am happy to see that everything is now moving in the direction of having a joint statement a statement by the Member States the European Commission and the European Parliament thus showing that the commitment to the European Union is today a shared commitment of the main political institutions of our Union P I am pleased to see that the search for an institutional settlement is also a priority for the German Presidency So I am confident that the elements are in place for an important breakthrough This is important because Europe needs an institutional settlement There are indeed serious costs derived from not having a constitutional treaty We need the constitutional treaty because as a European Union we need to be more effective in our decisionmaking more coherent in our external action and more transparent and democratic in our working Make no mistake the Commission will be an active player in the search for solutions here P When this Commission took office there was unfinished business to deal with and to reform With the help of this Parliament and the Council these things have been dealt with put behind us or turned around we now have the financial perspectives we now have the revised Stability and Growth Pact In fact I hope tomorrow we can say we will have the revised Services Directive to be approved by a parliamentary vote That shows that we are solving some of the planning problems and proposals P It has been hard work but it is already bearing fruit The 2007 Work Programme builds on these new foundations P So we can conclude the work on decisions that were already in the pipeline but also launch new very important projects for the work of Europe such as energy policy For the first time we have the chance to have a real common approach to energy to be more ambitious in the fight against climate change to look at the entire field of justice and at the fight against illegal migration This is a new frontier for Europe and we need to take a European approach So we see that Europe is on the move There are problems We know the problems that exist but there are great possibilities and there is more than ever the need for a strong Europe P So as we celebrate Europes 50th anniversary next year we can do so with much greater confidence Once again I believe Europe will be able to show its relevance by reinventing itself for the 21st century P To show our commitment to practical results and to working hard for a stronger European Union this can be a fitting birthday present for the 50th anniversary of Europe a birthday present for Europe and all its citizens P Applause P Broad policy guidelines on behalf of the PPEDE Group FR Mr President Commissioners I should like first of all to congratulate the European Commission which is presenting us with a much more political programme today and which for the first time is going all out for simplification by presenting a reduced number of priority sectors in its legislative and work programme for 2007 That will be useful to us in a year that promises to be crucial for the European Union as it is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome It will indeed be necessary to breathe new life into European integration by renewing the link with our fellow citizens P You are indeed presenting to us a series of 21 strategic initiatives perhaps rather too many for some people which will be at the heart of the Commissions activities in 2007 as well as a series of priority initiatives which will have to be adopted in the course of the next 12 to 18 months P This legitimate demand for flexibility appears at least to our Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats to entail two possible disadvantages Firstly the drawing up in parallel of two lists of priorities inevitably creates some confusion concerning the relative importance to be attached to each type of objective and concerning the links between the two categories Secondly spreading the programme out over 18 months means that there is a danger of slowing down the work of the Commission Our group therefore believes that it would be more appropriate to retain annual twelvemonth structuring and above all to require ourselves to respect the deadlines something that does not always happen at present P We also need to remain alert to the fact that many of the ambitious objectives announced by the European Commission need to take account of the budgetary provisions in force Nor must pointless structures constantly be created I am thinking for example of the creation of new agencies in order to solve this or that problem One has the impression in the end that when no solution is found to a problem the decision is taken to create an agency That being said a number of agencies manifestly continue to be effective on the model of the European Medicines Agency P Before going on to create other structures however let us firstly take stock of the existing structures Otherwise you are in danger of one day proposing to us the creation of a new agency designed to divide up and supervise the agencies in each Member State Do we really need to have 27 agencies because we shall have 27 Member States Costs must remain reasonable and produce what our AngloSaxon friends call proper value for money that is to say a sound costbenefit ratio P The Commissions work programme also emphasises the importance of impact studies and restates the Commissions intention to create a new body responsible for supporting such studies and monitoring their quality Parliament will keep a watchful eye on these impact studies and emphasises the need for objectivity so that they are carried out with the greatest possible transparency P In order to improve European competitiveness we shall ensure that there is a reduction in all forms of bureaucracy and that any superfluous legislation is done away with In this area it is important to involve the European Parliament more and to improve the ex post evaluation of the measures adopted P For this reason Mr President our group believes that the number of strategic initiatives needs to be reduced so as to avoid the pitfall of having too many of them There is indeed a risk of moving away from a practical work programme a development that could harm the European Union P Our group is nonetheless very pleased with the six priority areas defined by the Commission for 2007 I shall not go back and list these priority areas but I should like to emphasise a number of points including the energy issue The European Unions growing dependence where energy is concerned is a factor of which account needs to be taken from now on and that is all the more the case since last weeks power failure The EU will have to seek other means of reducing the harmful effects of energy dependence Our group believes that energy efficiency the increased use of renewable sources of energy and a structured dialogue with the producer countries and with consumers will enable this objective to be achieved P A number of studies suggest that the European Union could create a million direct and indirect jobs in the energy efficiency sector Thus not only would the search for greater efficiency enable the European Unions economy to save considerable sums It could also make a major contribution to competitiveness and employment which are key objectives of the Lisbon agenda P We would also ask the Commission to continue to play a pivotal role in the fight against global warming which has consequences in economic and social as well as strictly environmental terms The European Union will have to bring all its weight to bear in requiring the use of certain ecologically more effective products P What is more 2007 will be the year of an important new stage in the historic process of enlargement of the European Union as it is then that our Bulgarian and Romanian friends will join us Moreover you yourself Mr President have just told us that enlargement of the EU is the most important tool for peace of the last fifty years P It is therefore essential for these priority areas to be seen as challenges that will have to be taken up It is also however a question of communicating more with all Europeans Our group welcomes moreover the Commissions initiative in making communication one of its strategic objectives P In conclusion I would point out to you that having arrived at the halfway point of our term of office we almost want to say let us stop talking about programmes as our fellow citizens hate lists of promises The watchwords are action more action and still more action Mr President we are ready to support you as we go down that route on behalf of the PSE Group DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen if you as I have done read the Commission programme for 2007 carefully you will actually say with some satisfaction that this is a good programme If all this becomes reality we will be able to be satisfied proud and happy P Nevertheless though one gets on reading it the feeling of having been here before of having read it already Where though I asked myself and so I had a look in my archives and dug out the legislative and working programme for 2006 Aha I knew it I really had read all this before P I then came to the conclusion that this is not an argument against the 2007 programme on the contrary indeed it is actually evidence of continuity in the ideas that the Commission is putting forward to us today and there is nothing wrong with that it is not a bad thing for the goals set out in the working programme are good ones Yes indeed climate change is the number one challenge that energy policy must be central in the coming year is not a matter of doubt P Since all those who hold power under you are present here Mr President of the Commission let me tell you and them speaking as a father that the safety of childrens toys is indeed important and vitally so Doing away with roaming charges will be a tremendous thing as one who uses the phone a lot I am behind you all the way on that Reducing bureaucracy is vitally important if we are to make the EU more efficient All these things are important and I could turn to any and every one of your Commissioners and tell them your portfolio is the most important of all P Nevertheless I ask myself the question as to why when we are doing all these good right and important things we are not getting through to people Why is it then that despite all these things people are not enthusiastic about the European project I think I have found the explanation for that For years on end the radical freemarketeers not least in the Commission have been telling us that all that is needed is to deregulate to do away with the rules and regulations and leave it to the market to sort everything out They have been telling us that the internal market will create the economic dynamism that we need in order to create jobs to guarantee living wages on which people can live securely but reality is something else Yes go on applaud P It is you radical freemarketeers who with the deregulation of the European internal market have enabled us to achieve the highest unemployment figures that Europe has ever seen that is what the reality of this internal market has turned out to be P Applause P That Mr President of the Commission is why something you have said in this debate something you have said for the first time in a long time may well be more important than the work programme as a whole and the important statement that you made was that without solidarity without social responsibility the internal market will not come to be If that is the line that the Commission is taking if that is the spirit motivating your working programme then you have our backing P Mr Poetterings spontaneous applause shows that he is both Christian and social and I think your statement is one of the most important that you have made to this House for a long time and it is for that reason that the approach you have set out today is a good one P Interruption CDU not CSU P While we are talking about this strategic work programme perhaps I might say something else to the President of the Commission about his new Commission for the Commission sitting here is an old one to be joined by two new Commissioners I have read Mr President of the Commission that you want to give the Romanian candidate the job of Commissioner for Multilingualism I am sure that as the hearings progress I will find out more about what is meant by that but I have to say that I think it rather insubstantial The multilingualism portfolio is not worthy of Mr Orban nor does it make sufficient demands of a Commissioner and so I do not understand why he is being given such a thin portfolio P I surmise that it reflects the view that we have to watch out for Europes diversity that we have to safeguard and sustain the European Unions multilingual character and that we think is absolutely the right thing to do so why not create a proper portfolio for it P Something that this House has had to discuss over and over again during the last few plenary sessions is the threats facing minorities in the European Union among them a growing potential for extremism not least of a rightwing nature for xenophobia and antiSemitism for minorities even in the European Union are increasingly under threat under attack and in need of protection Minorities and for example their languages are a sign of the diversity that makes Europe so strong P It is for that reason that I recommend to you that you give some thought to expanding this portfolio and including within it not only multilingualism but also the protection of minorities in general That would make it all the clearer what you intend to achieve by it and then or so I could well imagine you could get even wider support for this proposal in this House P Speaking in general terms I would have been glad if the Presidency of the Council had been present to take note of the Commissions strategic work programme for many many things that the President of the Commission has come here with his Commissioners to put before us can be realised only if the men and women in the individual governments of the EU whom the Council represents put into effect those things that the Commission proposes and we enact Their absence from this debate is symptomatic of their attitude towards this European Union P Applause Mr President Commissioners researchers into time found out this past week that the second half of life passes much more quickly than the first and that which is true of life is also of course true of the lifetimes of legislatures so since your Commission has not much time left it should be all the more ambitious in its approach to doing its work What that means in terms of the work programme is that it ought to have been the prelude to a final spurt aiming high and promising speed Can that though be said of this document The Liberals and Democrats take the view that it cannot for it ushers in nothing of the sort P Let me begin though by talking about the good things we have found in your programme like the focus on the reduction of bureaucracy on the assessment of the costs that legislation will entail on simplification in other words the emphasis on better lawmaking and certainly on less of it that is a very good thing to aim at and in that respect we are wholeheartedly behind you What I want to say for the benefit of those who fear that the EU is turning into a neoliberal completely deregulated market economy and in saying it I will also highlight Mr Poetterings spontaneous applause for something Mr Schulz mentioned as an example of what the Grand Coalition is all about is that those who think the EU is a neoliberal market economy probably also think that Cuba is a democracy P Now for my second point you prioritised communication with the public and that too is something we think is a good thing we are glad that you are doing this for if the EU loses its basis and fails to build a citizens Europe then it will not achieve anything worth mentioning either The EU needs the public as its constant partner in dialogue it is on them that a single European Union will be founded P If I may turn to the structure of the document and Mr Schulz should read it more carefully it differs substantially from last years in that it is clear how the text and its annex fit together whereas their failure to do so last year was something of which we were critical We urged to you to make the connection between the two clear and you have managed to do so so many thanks for that It even specifies the legal basis for each legislative initiative and that too makes a great deal of difference and you provide explanations of them which makes the whole thing so much more manageable Why though are the existing legal acts the ones to be continued in 2007 not listed alongside them Why too does the structure not make it even clearer what is about legislation and what is not Why then are you in essence changing the picture P Let me add something on the subject of multilingualism I have heard speculations in this House to the effect Mr Barroso that this was your very subtle way of highlighting the possibility of there being too many commissioners and that this portfolio was intended to show this up in so to speak a symbolic way P In the course of this debate my colleagues will be discussing the various policy areas energy climate change and legal policy among them but I would like to take this opportunity to give you an idea of what overall impact your programme has had on our group We very definitely see ourselves as having the role of accompanying you in your work in a spirit of constructive criticism and that of course means cooperating with you but with an emphasis on constructive criticism P We see this programme as a puzzle with many individual pieces one that cannot really be put together in such a way as to produce a big picture We cannot find in it any clear policy guidelines nor any answers not even attempts at answers to the big questions facing the EU in the shape of enlargement and the constitutional treaty Nor can we understand why it is that there is not one word in the whole document about humanitarian aid and help with development areas in which the EU is the biggest player on earth so why are they not mentioned Even though your Commission has not achieved much to put it politely where the completion of the internal market is concerned you are carrying on down the same path and there is no evidence we can see of a holistic and comprehensive approach P Innovation too which is quite crucial to Europe being at the heart of the Lisbon Strategy is mentioned so to speak only in passing and in terms of the European Institute of Technology and the Seventh Research Framework Programme Our view is that what innovation needs most of all is freedom and the right conditions rather than institutions and more support measures which tend to take us in the wrong direction P This years programme does not in fact have a title Why not then It does rather give the impression that not only are the pieces of the puzzle difficult to put together but also that some of them may well be missing on behalf of the VertsALE Group FR Mr President Mr President of the Commission Commissioners in drafting these few lines on your work programme I wanted in the brief time allotted to me to draw attention to the draft Constitutional Treatys motto Unity in diversity as I think that in the current international and European political context we have more need of unity than of diversity in the European Union We need unity and it is for the Commission in particular to be the standard bearer for this unity I also believe that in view of the current weakness of a divided Council I am thinking for example of the failure of the Working Time Directive we do not expect the Commission to anticipate the divisions of the Council but to be bullish in the proposals it is to put to us P When objectives are not achieved and when selfimposed obligations to produce results are not met there must be no question of lowering ones sights or reducing ones targets On the contrary more resources have to be demanded and in these conditions I think that you will have Parliaments support Of a number of areas to which the strategic priorities shared by ourselves apply I want specifically to quote the example of the subject on which my group has probably worked most during the last two and a half years namely that involving the climate energy and transport We have sent to your department and to the departments of your colleagues details of an energy policy strategy that would enable us to achieve a 30 emission rate for CO2 and greenhouse gases between now and 2020 P Mr Barroso the European Union must fulfil its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol but it is not at present doing so That is why we think it necessary to put restrictive arrangements in place similar to those with which we are familiar in connection with budgetary discipline By that I mean that the European Union should not only assume obligations in terms of results but also give itself sufficient resources That is why we think that the emissions trading system needs to be improved and to be coordinated by the Commission and that it needs to be possible under the system to impose sanctions on Member States that do not respect their own objectives P In the case of renewable sources of energy we think that the Commission needs to propose sectoral objectives and not only general objectives As for energy efficiency we are waiting for the Commission to propose a revision of the Buildings Directive to cover all buildings As Mrs Grossetête has indicated the construction industry also creates economic activity as you well know P In this area of the climate energy and transport we must in other words reduce gas emissions reduce dependence on energy imports and reduce the risks It is because of this last concern that we continue to be opposed to nuclear power We must finally in Nairobi make serious preparations for Kyoto 2 P I should like to quote another example where European unity should be in evidence the imperative need to introduce common minimum social standards at European level We cannot give up this commitment That is why we want the Commission to propose a framework directive on services of general interest on behalf of the GUENGL Group DE Mr President even though I do not doubt that the Commissions staff in drafting the work plan for 2007 did their work with great exactitude and precision I have to say that I do not think that either the priorities for the work to be done or the tendencies it highlights really respond to the demands of the present time P They have to do with problem areas for which the EU does indeed bear responsibility but which go well beyond its bounds I am thinking here of such priority areas as poverty social exclusion growing inequalities and divisions in society or indeed the commercialisation of social life the destruction of nature and culture and of such issues as the loss of democracy repression war militarisation or speaking more generally the way in which global problems are addressed and commitment to the achievement of the millennium development goals something that we ought particularly to care about in view of the fact that the UN has again found that the number of people going hungry is increasing further P The fact is that these problems and conflicts are not at the heart of the work programme and it is not on them that the Commission is concentrating its efforts Despite the good things in the working programme which we certainly endorse I do believe that its being put into effect will entail these problems getting worse for what is still central to the Commissions efforts is the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy which has competitiveness as its objective and I believe that will lead to global social and economic problems becoming more acute P There is no room in all this for the question of social models which we in this House have debated for so long What that ultimately boils down to in the Commissions work is the issue of greater flexibility and I have to tell Mr Barroso that such a narrow view will not I think enable the social dimension of the European Union that he has announced to become reality P There is a second priority area that I would like to address It is stated in the programme that what economic life demands is more internal market rather than more regulation and the programme prioritises the creation and development of a European internal market for armaments Perhaps I might make bold to ask that someone might tell me of just one deficit within the European Union that this European internal market in weaponry thus created and brought in through the back door might actually remedy and also inform me as to who actually authorised the Commission to develop one P It was after all not least because of something of that sort that the draft constitution failed and was rejected I regard this as irresponsible and I think that adjustments are needed here as a matter of urgency if policy is actually to be developed in the European Union instead of people merely throwing slogans around These adjustments must result in people once more being able to identify much more strongly with the European Union P General statements about peoples fear of the dismantling of social services are of no use to us we have to actively do something to counteract it What people need is real projects and initiatives that is why we have to address the real issues There are alternatives though and I believe they can be summed up in three projects making the EU democratic making it socially and environmentally sustainable and making it into a force for peace one that endeavours to resolve global problems democratically and in a spirit of solidarity on behalf of the UEN Group Mr President I would like to welcome President Barroso and the Members of the Commission to the Chamber P Two points struck me immediately in the speeches and comments I heard earlier on Firstly when did it become a sin to be radical when was it ordained that we should not try to create something new and different and when we see mistakes not try to right them In particular the fact that we live in such a rapidly changing world brought about through innovation and technology requires a more rapid response from the European Union to ensure that we can defend as best as possible the interests of all EU citizens P Secondly there are obviously going to be carryover issues from one year to the next on which agreement has yet to be reached We have already seen this when dealing with the Services Directive over the last six years where even now we are only at second reading We will have to deal with many more issues like that P I would however like to make three points Firstly with regard to the Lisbon Agenda there is still so much lacking in terms of the necessary legislative framework that must be put in place to make Lisbon a reality The whole area of innovation research and development is one that we talk about a lot but in which concrete legislative action to protect design patents and copyright and to allow for proper investment in research and development in financial terms is still lacking P I have spoken many times in this Chamber on the European Institute of Technology and the wonderful advance and focal point for excellence that would represent However this is the positive side of things and we seem to be regressing in other areas P The Commission is talking about a harmonised taxation system but wherever harmonised taxation has taken place it has been contrary to good competition economic growth and employment growth Tax competition within the European Union has been healthy for growth and has been beneficial and of assistance One must of course have a level playing field as regards state aids and other similar areas and we do have this We can quite rightly bring Member States under control when they go above and beyond what is allowable as regards assisting industries or assisting employment creation opportunities However taxation is solely a national interest issue It is one that still requires unanimous agreement and I think it behoves us to stand up and say that the legal bases of the Treaties do not allow the Commission to come forward with a proposal for tax harmonisation They do not allow it to force countries to increase taxes and they do not allow it to force countries to lower taxes P Finally the CFSP has been one of the European Unions key successes Take Kosovo Africa and other developments around the world where the European Union has responded positively to putting peacekeepers and police forces in the field and to promoting other constructive developments on the ground We must continue to enlarge and expand that role Mr President Mr President of the Commission it is just as well that the Commissioners do not have voting rights Otherwise we could soon be voted down in this House It is also good that the Commission is proposing more voluntary coordination through communications instead of binding rules but I fear that the compulsory dimension will rather come from the European Court of Justice and from the Commissions own use of rules governing competition and state aid That is of course what the Commission has done for example with its communication on music rights Parliament had adopted one position which the Commission did not like The Commission then turned to matters relating to the abuse of monopolies and adopted a communication instead of rules which it would perhaps never have been possible to adopt The European Parliament and the national parliaments should demand that all draft communications be submitted to them In that way we can make it known whether we want to have binding rules or a cocktail of communications and of decisions by the European Court of Justice P I wish to commend the Commission for having every week since 15 September sent proposals to the Member States for submission to the proximity and necessity test As far as I know the parliaments have not however responded once How lazy can they be as representatives of the people On Monday and Tuesday the national parliaments will come together for the COSAC meeting in Helsinki and they should not miss the opportunity to put some order into the jungle of laws from Brussels Let all the specialist committees and European Affairs Committees colourcode every single proposal black if the national parliament wants to see binding EU laws green if there are to be minimum provisions with the option of better protection for welfare health the environment the working environment security consumer protection and animal welfare yellow if the desire is merely for voluntary coordination instead of binding laws and red if the EU is to steer completely clear of a matter With colourcoding like that it would be very easy for the Commission to see at a glance what is wanted In this way it would be possible to obtain bottomup European cooperation instead of the centralism that we have at present NL Mr President I gather from the work programme that the Commission and I quote would like to listen more to the citizens in order to involve them more in the policy process As the Dutch cabaret artist Wim Sonneveld might have said nou breekt mn klomp that takes the biscuit or something very like that Perhaps I might remind the Commission that the European public to whom it is referring has already made its opinions abundantly clear for example about the socalled European Constitution and that they have by means of referendums consigned this project to the wastepaper basket in the Netherlands and in France and that the Commission despite everything repeated only a few weeks ago that the spirit of this Constitution whatever the citizen may think should in any event remain intact Listen to what I have to say about citizen involvement but do not whatever you do judge me by my actions P Incidentally there is no reference in the document to the petition of a million European citizens about the travelling circus swallowing up millions that is the European Parliament I know strictly speaking it should be the Council that should be lectured on this but the Commission which interferes in God knows what anyway and whose own budget moreover is being slated year after year by the Court of Auditors could have sent out a signal about the fact that the European citizens are fed up to the back teeth with the Eurocrats squandering of money and enjoyment of privileges We should no longer keep quiet about this P Then there is public opinion to consider It is indisputable that the European citizens reject en masse the accession negotiations with Turkey which is not a European country and yet these negotiations are simply continued undoubtedly also beyond December This proves in fact that the socalled open ending of the negotiations is nothing but total bunk and that the Eurocracy including the Commission decided a long time ago that the Turkish accession must come what may be rammed down the throats of these European citizens that have or so they say been listened to so well P I should like to finish off with a final comment about an important matter namely what is termed economic immigration and the idea that new immigrants must be attracted which if it was up to the Commission would certainly not just be a handful of highly educated individuals This view has just been confirmed by the President of the Commission himself The absurdity of the idea that massive immigration of nonEuropeans is economically profitable in order to alleviate the effects of the demographic situation in Europe has been demonstrated before P The immigration that we have experienced firsthand is an immigration of people who cannot read or write combined with religions and cultures that cannot be assimilated Putting it bluntly we are importing even more unemployment even more rootlessness along with the effects of this all namely crime rundown areas and de facto apartheid This also involves enormous economic costs P For those reasons and many others I conclude that we can do no other than express our disapproval of this work programme that is so full of platitudes and good intentions that cannot be kept and in which the essential concerns of the European citizens are completely overlooked Mr President I would firstly thank the honourable Members for their comments Members do confirm that this is a more political programme as recognised by Mrs Grossetête whom I thank for her general support for the programme Our objective is indeed to join with the other institutions notably Parliament in better targeting the priorities each year and placing them in the context of Europes overall efforts P Since I cannot reply to all the specific questions I shall reply at least to those that I think particularly important beginning with the principle of annuality This principle is not called into question Far from it We are establishing very clearly the 21 strategic initiatives for next year and committing ourselves not to withdraw any of them once they are under way At the same time however we are offering Parliament and the other institutions the opportunity to acquaint themselves in the course of the next six months with what we are including in our programme and the opportunity to draw their conclusions in advance if the work is complete P This is a good example of the combination of flexibility and security Secure in the knowledge of what may be done in the course of next year you have increased flexibility which in turn means that Parliament can do a better job of setting out its programme That is what we aim to achieve and I also hope that it is in keeping with what you need in terms of your work P Mr Schulz recognised a number of features from other programmes True there is a degree of continuity We want to maintain an element of coherence The work done by the Commission and by the other European institutions cannot consist in reinventing the wheel each year One of my countrys great thinkers said that in speaking the truth one cannot be original every day There is some truth in that We are sticking to these objectives We need to keep the pressure up and show great determination The achievement of a large portion of these objectives does not depend simply on the Commission and Parliament It also depends on the Member States That is why we must continue to be coherent over time and to be so in the interests of a Europe that is not only more competitive but also characterised by greater solidarity and by greater resolve on the world stage In the light of this there is indeed an element of continuity which is also to be found in the motto Unity in diversity referred to by Mr Jonckheer and other Members P To reply specifically to Mr Schulzs question I would say as I have already done to Mr Orban that my idea is for the Commissioner appointed by Romania to assume responsibility not only for multilingualism but also for interculturalism in Europe so supplementing the work done under my direction by the Bureau of European Policy Advisers BEPA which organises meetings on this subject It is also what Commissioner Figel does on the subjects of education and culture P As soon as his appointment has been confirmed by the institutions Mr Orban will therefore be given responsibility for multilingualism which is a very important subject for Europe It is by no means a second class portfolio When you think how many languages are used in the EU a policy not only on multilingualism but also on interculturalism seems to be more and more necessary if we really want to respect the diversity of the EU Dialogue between the various cultures needs to be established and efforts made to integrate the different communities without of course neglecting the minority communities within the EU P I believe therefore that it is a highly important portfolio that will be entrusted to Mr Orban as soon as his candidacy has been approved P As for the question put by Mrs KochMehrin I accept above all the point on which we most agree namely the need to go all out for less bureaucracy and more efficiency This is not a mere statement of intent At the meeting of the College that took place this very day the Commission approved a reduction in the obligations imposed on small and mediumsized enterprises in Europe to supply statistics Instead of asking them all to make the presentations designed for statistical purposes we shall ask for information on a sampling basis and confine ourselves to requiring only a portion of the information otherwise available I believe that this is a practical measure to reduce the administrative burden on our companies and particularly on small and mediumsized companies P We shall of course study the proposals for combating climate change presented in the person of Mr Jonckheer by the Group of the GreensEuropean Free Alliance Be assured that we want very much to continue to be a world leader on this issue and we in the European Commission have in particular committed ourselves to strengthening the emissions trading system to attaching more importance to renewable sources of energy and to working to achieve better levels of energy efficiency Perhaps there will be a number of differences in terms of practical objectives but I believe that there is a convergence of views between our institutions about the point of the actions to be taken and the ambition behind them P Regarding the issue of climate change I want to tell you that in our view it is closely linked to the energy question In this area we do see the solid outlines of a possible accommodation between the concerns of those who like yourselves are more ambitious where the environment is concerned and those who are more ambitious when it comes to competitiveness The two sets of concerns are not mutually exclusive On the contrary Contained therein are extraordinary economic opportunities for the Europe of tomorrow P In the same way I think that there is an opportunity to be seized in the area of innovation and in this connection I would particularly thank Mr Crowley for his support for the European Institute of Technology which I think will be Europes workshop of the future More and more the work that needs to be done is that on combating climate change and on pursuing a coherent energy policy and a Europe that is not only more competitive but that also derives its strength from a sustainable economy marked by solidarity all of which presupposes of course greater investment in innovation P In conclusion I shall try to reply to the question put to me by Mrs KochMehrin who was wondering what was the main theme that drew everything together At first sight it is difficult to see the connection between such diverse areas The common theme resides however in the objective of preparing Europeans to confront the age of globalisation not to submit to it but to face up to it and not to see it as the end of Europe but on the contrary to have the courage to affirm our values and interests while at the same time helping by means of our beliefs and our values of democracy freedom and indeed solidarity to shape that very globalisation and the future of the 21st century Therein lies the common theme linking the areas of energy and climate change to the areas not only of justice and home affairs but also of innovation and education That is our programme P Growth Employment Competitiveness on behalf of the PPEDE Group NL Mr President I too have great appreciation for the policy statement by the President of the Commission Mr Barroso and I am delighted that he now has a grasp of Dutch He can understand Dutch The Commission President understands Dutch I should like to make five comments with regard to the statement P I am delighted about his remark that Europe is more than just a market When you say this though you also have to follow it through This means to us and we will be putting this request in the resolution that you have to outline the consequences of the internal market on the European citizens Once those consequences have been mapped out it is possible to respond adequately P I would like to make a second remark by way of priority The combination of work and family more people within this labour market is also one of the priorities in the Lisbon process We would like to see more action on this score P Thirdly a Green Paper on labour legislation is pending We have seen this announced for a long time but when exactly will it be issued P Fourthly President Barroso mentioned attracting immigration When I hear this I wonder how I should justify this to the colleagues from Poland Bulgaria and Romania who will be approaching us shortly where this free movement of workers has not even taken off yet I would appreciate a response to this P Fifthly I should like the Social Affairs Commissioner to attend more to all matters that are still outstanding in the Council namely posting of workers working hours legislation but also the mobility of pensions which I happen to know leads to major problems and to which a number of improvements are now being made at Commission level too We as a group in Parliament are happy to have further discussions with you on these matters Mr President we have taken note of what the President of the Commission has had to say about the new Commission particularly about the new Commissioner Mr Orban and I have to tell him that a certain amount of clarification is still called for not least in consultation with Commissioner Figel as regards among other things the question of who is to have responsibility for dialogue between cultures and religions although it has to be said that this sort of expansion goes some way towards meeting the expectations of Social Democrats like ourselves P Secondly and still on the same subject we will of course be asking the new Commissioners about their commitment to the programme for a social Europe and to solidarity to which you have made reference It is because the Commission is a collegial body that we will be questioning all new Commissioners as to their actual commitment to this social Europe P Thirdly Mr President of the Commission there is growth and social security you were right to describe this as a political programme and important steps have indeed been taken in this direction but let me give you two examples of where we see progress as being needed The energy sector for example although Commissioner Piebalgs appears not to be here is an important factor in terms of growth and job creation but when a Head of Government asks how we are meant to run a single European energy policy when everything is geared to liberalisation and nothing else then that is when the Commission must establish a political framework for the European energy policy P If I may turn to the transEuropean networks indirect reference has today been made to your having at one time been very much in favour of using measures taken by the individual countries as a means of pressing on with coordination and it is this coordinating role that I would ask you to exercise I would also emphasise once more that we see solidarity as the principal objective of the European Union on behalf of the ALDE Group SV Mr President Commission fellow Members ladies and gentlemen I intend to devote my speaking time to three elements of the Commissions work programme namely global competitiveness green growth and energy All three of these issues are crucial dimensions of a competitive Europe P Firstly then global competitiveness Europes future lies in competing at the cutting edges of research with quality and with skill Only in that way can we retain the European model The Seventh Framework Programme is therefore the most important document on industrial policy for many years I am afraid I have to say that there is to some degree a lack of drive in this work programme It is a good and important thing to engage in space exploration but where are the ambitions in relation to the medical industry Why is IT mentioned only in the context of IT crime If I were to express one wish it would be for a more cohesive strategic plan to enable us to compete in the 21st century P Secondly the environment and growth All too often when documents such as this are presented one gets the feeling that the environment and growth are somehow mutually opposed I am convinced that this is not so something that I think is proved through the work of REACH In the next few decades the world will be forced to do something about the climate issue This will involve new technology for saving energy new technology to power cars and so on There will be an enormous market for environmentally friendly technology and for energyefficient products That is where our European companies should be I therefore wish that over the next year the Commission might devote more energy to developing environmentdriven growth P Thirdly energy Europes competitiveness stands or falls according to whether or not it has a secure and economically feasible energy supply P It is easier to fight for your principles than to live up to them but I hope that the Commission manages to do the latter when it comes to global competitiveness green growth and a secure and sustainable energy supply on behalf of the VertsALE Group Mr President I would like to point out to the Commissioner that we are going to have to carry on talking about old and new Member States for as long as we have the transition periods to which my colleague Mrs OomenRuijten referred P However I was also very pleased to hear Mr Barroso talking about dealing with unscrupulous employers I assume by that he means those employers who keep people in conditions approaching slavery pay them extremely badly and exploit them with this applying of course not just to those who employ not only thirdcountry nationals but also EU nationals as we have been hearing about recently I assume that measure will be part of driving up job quality as we have talked about so often by getting rid of lowquality poorly paid employment and I look forward to seeing that mentioned more explicitly in the Commissions programme P As others have said we are very pleased to see as well this continued mention of sustainable development and linkage with climate change which is something we have long argued for and I agree entirely with what Mrs Ek was saying about environmentallydriven growth We therefore look forward to the action plan on sustainable production and consumption next year which we assume will be a move forward in terms of ecoefficiency and in spelling out how we are to decouple environmental damage from growth P We also look forward to the stocktaking social reality document which is extremely important as regards benchmarks of wellbeing We assume this will also include environmental factors given that we know that the poorest people often live in the poorest and most degraded environments and housing with the effects that has on mental health P We would rather have seen a framework directive on social services but will nevertheless be looking to see whether the proposals brought forward also take into account the effects of existing European legislation on the future of services P Finally we would have welcomed something that picked up on the sustainable development strategy as regards the issue of targeted training for professions in helping to meet climate change requirements If you cannot fit solar panels and cannot repair your energy systems you are not going to meet your climate change targets P Applause on behalf of the GUENGL Group PT Mr President reading the legislative programme and listening to the presentation of the Commissions work for 2007 we can but conclude that we are in for more of the same more of the same neoliberalism which is undermining social and labour rights which is making work more unstable which is returning to old methods of exploitation which is promoting the liberalisation of services including public services leaving no one in any doubt as to the intentions behind what is referred to as the Lisbon Strategy P In the name of flexibility the completion of the internal market and globalisation employment contracts are being trampled underfoot and there is a danger of more multinational company relocations as in the case of GM Opel in Azambuja Johnson Controls in Nelas and Portalegre and Lear in Valongo to name but a few of the most serious cases currently threatening thousands of workers in Portugal where unemployment is already very high following redundancies in the textile clothing and footwear industries P It is these unemployed workers who are now at the mercy of temporary employment agencies and other unscrupulous bosses as in the recent cases we have heard about in the media of hungry and penniless Portuguese workers in the south of the Netherlands Is this the social responsibility of business in action At the same time in the name of the single currency and price stability the European Central Bank regularly raises interest rates and governments use the Stability and Growth Pact to undermine manufacturing hinder social development undermine micro and small enterprises and create a culture that is conducive to the shameful exploitation of emigrant and immigrant workers and their families P We therefore stress the need for a sea change away from these neoliberal policies The time has come to prioritise social development and welfare policies and I should like to call for solidarity in the case of hungry exploited Portuguese workers such as those in the south of the Netherlands whose cases have just come to light on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President European integration is just part of the solution to the question of economic growth in Europe The Member States themselves making their own decisions relating to public finance and economic reform have a key role to play here P In this respect we have many examples of good practice The success of domestic reforms in some countries has allowed them to quickly absorb enlargement in 2004 and to adopt the principles of the common market in all areas The success of countries such as Ireland Finland Holland or Great Britain has allowed these countries to regard world competition more calmly P On the other hand a social model based on rigid and short working time and on avoiding competition not just at a global level but at the level of the common market is the road to social and economic crisis P This political and economic alignment of forces within Europe gives me serious doubts as to whether the oftmentioned Constitutional Treaty is a good solution to our economic pains It will give those countries which are less adept at resolving their internal problems increasing influence on EU affairs We will lose the balance between different models and restrict competition between systems This diagnosis of the alignment of forces has come as a result of the debates on services working time and worker delegation Speaking figuratively I am worried by a treaty which as regards legislative and regulatory matters will give us less Britain and more Germany and France P Of all the activities the Commission plans to undertake in 2007 the most important to me are those in respect of better regulation It is a disgrace that an organisation that has for 50 years given voice to the four basic freedoms enshrined in its treaties today costs business EUR 600 billion per year And it is an even greater disgrace that despite the agreements made in the last year it has been impossible to reduce red tape and or to improve European law P I hope that 2007 will mark a breakthrough in this respect However this will not happen if we cannot honestly answer questions about the reasons for this failure in 2006 How is it that proposals for streamlining codification and unifying European law face resistance And who is resisting them Where are the Gordian knots that we have not managed to cut P I would very much like to hear an answer to these questions today on behalf of the INDDEM Group SV Mr President legal certainty means that the exercise of power and the administration of justice can be anticipated on the basis of legal rules It is clear from its legislative and work programme for 2007 that the Commission expects the draft Constitution to be implemented This is despite the fact that large majorities in the Netherlands and in France have rejected the draft The struggle between the political establishment and the peoples of Europe continues apace then P The European project is on a dangerous road The European Court of Justice will lose its legitimacy as a result of the arrogant attitude it displays towards the popularly elected governments of the Member States The Court of Justice is in reality a selfappointed power in Europe It chose to declare itself the guardian of the principle of the separation of powers even before the Amsterdam Summit of 1998 It did this without any democratic or political basis whatsoever The Court of Justice has also made clear to the national courts that they cannot regard themselves as independent but rather that they represent the extended arm of the Court of Justice through which it performs its judicial activism P I would therefore call on the Members of this House to think things over before it is too late The EU does not need more concentration of power with no democratic basis The EU needs competition not just between companies on the market in order to create better products but between countries in order to come up with sound political solutions to the problems of the day Mr President the Commission will review the operation of the single market and about time too I hope that the Commission will read the report by the Conseil dAnalyse Economique a highpowered economic committee of the French Government chaired by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin That report says economic integration has stagnated and no longer promotes growth It says that the euros creation has not produced the knockon benefits expected Then it gets serious We are convinced that the situation we describe is perilous It says that poor economic performance is driving away investment and damaging employment and social provision and it speaks of a manifest exhaustion with Community procedures threatening to trigger a vicious circle which will unravel the acquis communautaire P I hope the Commission will note the estimate by its own VicePresident Günter Verheugen who says that the costs of excessive regulation in the single market amount to EUR 600 billion a year That is nearly four times the Commissions own estimate of the trade benefits from the single market P In a recent UK study of more than 1000 CEOs commissioned by the thinktank Open Europe a clear majority felt that the EU was doing more harm than good and that Britain should renegotiate its relationship with Europe to something more like a free trade deal The position is very clear Europes share of world trade is shrinking fast Membership is costing far more than any benefits it offers EU regulation and the EU social model are doing huge economic damage The EU is making us poorer and less democratic and less free and we have had enough of it DE Mr President Commissioners ladies and gentlemen I am sure that Mr Helmer would defend the British internal market which he sees as geographically limited without wishing to undermine the principle of the market economy P I think Mr Schulz that we may have a semantic problem here For me the market means meeting customers needs and providing a range of services and products that the public actually buy That is my understanding of the market That I think is why your speech received so much applause We must not design the European single market and determine what we offer on it in future without taking into account the needs of the public P The second thing and it is something I see as very important is the energy issue Energy together with agriculture is going to be one of the big issues full stop We will need more initiatives to be taken on the renewable energy front and on the food front considering the way prosperity is on the increase in China India and many other countries around the world we will need a lot of energy for new and relatively highquality foods We see the opening up of markets on the international level as having absolute priority We should be creating new openings for our farmers and food producers to sell their products in future P Moving on to the CO2 debate I would like to ask what we are supposed to do when a barrel of crude oil sells in Russia for 8 dollars and to heavy industry too whereas here one has to fork out anything up to 80 dollars and emission trading also means that we have to pay the CO2 levy so that our energy and hence our raw materials industries are subject to double taxation How this being so are we supposed to keep jobs in Europe P A debate on the subject of these disparities on the market is urgently called for and in the sphere of foreign policy too We will indeed see whether Russia allows its neighbours to pay the same prices as it charges at home this will make for exciting debates in the future From the employment and social standpoint I find this work programme very disappointing Yet again we are promised little more than a raft of Green and White Papers and communications recycling the same old material We are about to get a Green Paper on labour law that lists questions that were put and answered ten years ago by Allan Larsson while he was the Commissions DirectorGeneral for Employment P The communication hails flexicurity as a means of realising opportunities offered by European labour markets In reality it has been shown to have no positive meaning for working people For millions flexicurity is a weasel word a codeword for exploitation insecurity and uncertainty We need an EU legislative framework to tackle unfair and exploitative employment and quasiemployment relationships All workers in all regions deserve access to decent work to give them and their families the chance of a decent life P In the meantime social Europe is at a standstill The last piece of EU legislation in the social field was adopted over three years ago The Commissions lack of ambition reflects its own imbalanced policy perspective Better regulation means no legislation in the social field but also reflects the poor prospects for any proposal in the Employment Council Employment ministers need to begin to play a positive role and they could start by doing something positive on working time and temporary agency work Lisbon promised more and better quality jobs What has been done to deliver that promise for working people Precious little P So my message to both the Commission and Council is this let us stop the rhetoric and start to deliver P Applause Demographic change is one of the greatest challenges for European competitiveness We want to make it a priority to bring people who are excluded into the job market elderly and disabled people included That is why the 2000 Employment Directive should be fully implemented But we must do more especially as 2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities P However I welcome the Commissions commitment to cutting down on unnecessary legislation That is why I ask the Commission to reaffirm its intention to withdraw the Temporary Agency Workers Directive and also to consider separating the issue of calculating what is considered as working time where someone is on call from that of the individual optout from the Working Time Directive P If we are really to achieve growth and competitiveness legislation should only be brought forward in the employment field if it cannot successfully be enacted at local or national level In the field of health and safety it should brought forward only if scientific and medical evidence prove the need for it as is the case for an amendment to the 2000 Biological Agents Directive to protect workers from needlestick injuries and contracting hepatitis or HIV Can the Commission tell us when it will bring forward that amendment to the Biological Agents Directive in line with the owninitiative report that was adopted by the European Parliament EL Madam President I wish to comment on three points in the European Commissions programme on employment The first relates to the Commission proposal to encourage the creation of common principles to strengthen job flexibility and security The Commission even notes that this combination has been recognised as a necessity By whom has it been recognised Obviously by the employers who approve the framework of the pure market However no one should cite the workers because it is they who suffer from minimum working times breaches of working times and flexibility of the market P My second comment concerns the question of immigration The Commission says that because the needs of the market have increased immigrants need to be approached That is exactly the message which the exploiters are waiting for in order to import cheap labour and use it to break domestic markets and reduce wages Immigrants should not be used as battering rams but as people with the same rights alongside local workers P Finally as with the directive on the liberalisation of services the same with the Commission programme the workers and citizens are not suffering from a problem of reduced perception as some have said they simply disagree and no one should misinterpret that IT Madam President ladies and gentlemen I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party The Commission communication on competitiveness is a necessary step towards implementing policies aimed at improving the Unions economic performance in the global context and within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy It is important as proposed to create a framework encouraging technological development innovation and support for the area of industry that through research and development is capable of expanding the EUs competitiveness in the more innovative sectors P I therefore support the proposals for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund the new generation of cohesion programmes and the guide to innovation proposed by Commissioner Hübner which encourage the regions to focus more closely on development and which I hope will provide sufficient information and support to allow our smallest and most vulnerable enterprises to respond to the new energy and commercial challenges in the international environment In fact I believe that is fundamental to support a key factor in the European economy small and mediumsized enterprises in particular those in manufacturing which are by nature less inclined to innovation and more vulnerable to the globalisation of the economy P While I welcome the adoption of good internal practices I also believe that it is essential for small and mediumsized enterprises to be suitably protected above all in the area of international trade particularly in connection with markets that exploit unfair competition and often do not reject practices that damage workers rights and at times even violate childrens rights to childhood IT Madam President ladies and gentlemen I too should like to address the Commission with some thoughts and suggestions Since within Europe there is a desire for Europe I believe that the responses that people expect are those of a strong Europe that is able to provide to direct and to propose This is the main reason why I believe that we need to put across a clearer summary of the truly significant propositions of our programmes Furthermore I believe that the Commission Parliament and the Council are making quite good progress having succeeded in recent years in delivering a series of directives and regulations responding to the demands for quality of the environment quality of life and greater integration P There are nonetheless important areas of European and international policy on which we must be more adventurous These areas have been pointed out to us in many of the speeches made today the environment energy employment security and immigration A common thread runs through all of these topics that of equal opportunities for all for young people facing the world of work who have a level of training that differs too much across the various Member States and equal opportunities for women who in this old Europe have not yet managed to attain the equality to which they are entitled even in the world of work FR Madam President Commissioner you should say to Mr Barroso that despite the high ambition of what he said we look forward to seeing his words converted into deeds and that what we therefore need if we want to win back our fellow citizens confidence is both better regulation which does not necessarily mean less regulation and what in the English turn of phrase is called the capacity to deliver P In the field of the ecologyenergy partnership which the Commission is extremely keen to see put in place and which Parliament will most certainly support we need to give some thought in advance to the resources required for bringing this about These do not amount solely to that capacity in terms of competence that the Constitution would supposedly have given us but also to capacity in budgetary and taxation terms The Commission needs therefore to lose no time in setting to work on revising the financial perspective so that this exercise is not simply compensatory but is marked by an ambition equal to what is at stake for the European Union in the 21st century P Of the 21 strategic initiatives only one falls within the competence of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs the idea of a communication a further one on social services of general interest There is not a word about the proposal you withdrew from the Commissions work agenda a move unanimously condemned by Parliament I am talking about the withdrawal of the proposal on mutuality Ask Mr Barroso what has become of the initiative in this area Parliament is awaiting a proposal P In the area of financial markets the exercise we are involved in is a dialogue between institutions We had made some definite and practical requests concerning microcredits alternative funds and rating agencies The Commission proposals have nothing to say about these subjects P Finally I would ask you to take relevant action in the field of accounting so enabling the European Union to be equal to the ambitions we need to espouse ES Madam President Madam VicePresident of the Commission Commissioners Mr Almunia better and better legislation requires better and better budgeting There is and there will be no new legislation or new initiatives for next year unless the Community institutions the Commission in particular carry out a full assessment of the availability of funds and of how to allocate the resources in the manner demanded by the Unions citizens P In other words the Union and the European Commission need legislative priorities and budgetary priorities that are in unison At the moment the Commissions current work programme is not consistent with the resolution adopted by the European Parliament for the annual political strategy or with the first reading of the European Parliament for 2007 P I would remind you of paragraph 47 of our resolution on the Annual Political Strategy in which we insist that the European institutions must reach an agreement on this legislative programme in December 2006 in order to coincide with the end of the budgetary procedure for 2007 P I shall end by mentioning the budgetary principles laid out by the European Parliament for the conditions for releasing the reserve for European Commission staff posts in 2007 When it comes to these conditions Parliament is the European Commissions ally here rather than the Council In particular we are asking for a commitment to improving the procedure for delivery to the European Parliament of the Commissions legislative and work programme which leads to the presentation in February 2007 of a legislative work programme for that year and which takes account of our budgetary vote in December P You and the Commissioner responsible for budgets in particular are perfectly aware of the situation and we therefore hope that we can reach an agreement at the conciliation on the 21st ES Madam President Commissioners the President of the Commission who has discourteously failed to attend this debate has justified the correction of his programme in an extraordinary fashion by quoting an anonymous philosopher from his country who defended truth Since the infallibility of the Commission is not laid down in the Treaties I believe that it would be more appropriate to quote the old proverb rectificar es de sabios to rectify is for the wise P The Commission has rectified two points that are important for next year Firstly the President of the Commission began to speak I would not say passionately but at least with a degree of enthusiasm about the European Constitution I welcome that Secondly the Commission has introduced immigration as an urgent issue P I would like to refer more specifically however to an issue that is very important and that cuts across everything we are talking about and which the President of the Commission has not mentioned the need to redirect the Doha Round of development negotiations It is an absolutely crucial issue which has a very direct influence on Europes policy towards globalisation and about which not a single word has been uttered P Are we going to continue along the line proposed by Commissioner Mandelson Is the bilateral going to be given priority over the multilateral How are we going to coordinate this issue with the environment policy and the human rights policy P I believe that this is an issue that the Commission must take into account and that it has not mentioned today ES Madam President I too regret that the Council is not here The Councils absence from these debates has become far too frequent and I believe it would be good to remind it that it should be here and that it should take good note of that P It was not here for the presentation of the Court of Auditors report this morning either Although Mr Weber President of the Court of Auditors has met with Ecofin the political debate amongst those of us representing the citizens takes place in this Chamber I therefore disapprove of the Finnish Presidencys absence P This morning we read the report of the House of Lords which gave us a real pasting it says that we do things badly that we do not control our spending Furthermore we have once again been presented with the report by the Court of Auditors a report that has always been negative ever since I joined this Parliament in 1994 For the last twelve years it has said that the Commission and the Council is making an effort but it has not given its approval P As Françoise Grossetête has said the Commissions programme is a political programme and I therefore believe that it is right for the Commission to aim high but it is doing little in terms of controlling spending P I would like to say to the Commission which is here today I regret that the ViceChairman of our Committee on Budgetary Control is not here and I thank Mr Almunia for listening that unless we spend properly the Council will continue to reduce the budget and we will end up without any Community policies P If your work programme says nothing about controlling the Europeans money what will happen in the end We will not even reach the 1 threshold Next year we will have 09 of the budget and we will end up with no Community policies in Europe P Get your act together please State that we want to spend well better than the Member States that we want to put the Member States in a position in which that can say that they agree with the way spending is carried out The citizens must be aware that if money is spent badly it is not just the Commissions fault but also the fault of the Member States of the agents P Let us get our act together let us do something not just for transparency but for good spending DE Madam President ladies and gentlemen I would like to start by following the chairman of my group Mr Schulz and highlighting something Mr Barroso said to the effect that without solidarity the internal market will not come into being He got that absolutely right and it comes up again in the text of the work programme in which the Commission commits itself and I quote to the delivery of an active policy agenda focusing on citizens expectations and needs That is precisely what is needed P It is not however enough simply to keep on saying that it also has to be brought to life It is evident to me from looking at the measures that the ones that really matter in the internal market are not there particularly those needed for the protection of consumers The term consumer protection is nowhere to be found Now you are looking to appoint a new Commissioner to handle it Does that mean that you want to have a rethink or a closer look and see to it that consumer protection really is put centre stage in policy If you do that is something that really will get across to the European public P I also note the lack of any progress towards harmonisation in European policy that might point to the Member States sharing in it that might indicate an openingup of borders in the services market and elsewhere for these things need to be tackled with much more vigour than they have been and there is plenty left to do on those fronts P Finally the most important thing is that the primary competence should be political You are always talking about impact assessments but what sort of impact assessment should be carried out Any impact assessment should also take into account social life gender policy and other areas as well P Cohesion protection of natural resources Madam President there is a tendency for all speakers to consider their issue as the most important in the debate As we are talking about the European Commissions legislative and work programme I wish to say as I shall be referring to regional development that we shall not have very important issues to debate next year P This year we passed the legislation and the major challenge for the European Commission is for this legislation to be applied correctly We need to start the application of programmes promptly so that the appropriations are taken up and more importantly European taxpayers money is used for the benefit of social and economic cohesion This is the major endeavour and Parliament wants to participate actively in this endeavour which we must jointly make together with the Member States and the regions We shall be present therefore to control what the European Commission is doing Within this framework the fourth report on cohesion which the European Commission is to present and which we are awaiting will obviously also be important P Within the framework of the purely legislative initiative there is the question of the Solidarity Fund in other words the fund which covers problems which arise from natural and technological disasters Here we have finished the first reading but there is an unjustified delay in the Council The old regulation is out of date and the European Union needs to demonstrate its solidarity in the areas affected especially when we are talking about major disasters because that is how it gets closer to its citizens The Commission therefore needs to stand by Parliament We need together to convince the Council which for some reason perhaps because the Ministers of Finance who are competent do not want to give any more money does not understand the need for us to proceed further We are therefore waiting for tangible proof from the European Commission on behalf of the PSE Group FI Madam President the legislation that applies to the European Union as a whole needs to be based on an analysis of where we are which of the measures that have already been taken have been effective and what new measures are needed for us to achieve the targets that have been jointly set This sort of approach is vital in environmental policy in order that we can focus on those matters that require swifter attention than any of the others P The European Commission promised to put forward a proposal to revise the Sixth Environment Action Programme this year We have not received one It is not included in next years Action Plan either It would nevertheless be a concrete instrument for specifically evaluating where we are and what should be done in the future P The Commission says that it intends to examine the Environmental Technologies Action Plan next year That is good We also however need to look at areas other than developments in energy technology One challenge we face is legislation on chemicals Harmful chemicals need to be replaced with new safe ones and for that we need technology We need technology to find solutions to air quality We need new technology for material efficiency and in this way we will also be able to redeem our promise of improved competitiveness P Applause on behalf of the ALDE Group FR Madam President Commissioners ladies and gentlemen there is a time for words and there is a time for action I think that quite a number of those who have spoken this afternoon on various subjects have demonstrated the absolute necessity for the European Commission to take action P We want more innovation more security more solidarity and more competitiveness and I am disappointed to see that the text presented to us by the Commission includes just a few lines on what is certainly the main heading in the European Unions budget given that the 20072013 financial perspective allocates EUR 308 billion to the Structural Funds However if we want to provide real answers for ourselves and for our fellow citizens with the Member States and with the various players we need to make good use of the tools provided by the financial measures included in the Structural Funds amounting as I said to EUR 308 billion P What therefore is the issue for 2007 Are we going to use the billions at our disposal to give our fellow Europeans real answers in the context of the regulations we adopted in this very House in July or mired in administrative mazes and in many and varied problems are we going to reach 31 December 2007 without having got much further forward I and my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development brought these matters up with Mrs Hübner we are disappointed that the Commissions document before us today pays hardly any attention to how the Commission intends to set out to achieve its objectives P We want these objectives to take particular account of circumstances in the new Member States which will receive funds but will also need to be in a position to use those funds wisely We have made proposals as Mrs Hübner knows and we are now waiting for practical responses to help these countries to use this money properly P There is another point that I as chairman of the Urban Housing Intergroup must obviously not neglect how can towns and cities act as a real driving force in a Europe that needs to be more competitive and more innovative On this matter too we are waiting for further action from the Commission P Finally on behalf of my colleague Mr Davies who cannot be here because he is at another meeting I would like to say to the Commissioners that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is partly satisfied with the proposals on the environment but that as in the case of the previous point on the Structural Funds we expect practical implementation we expect action P In conclusion Commissioners we have no complaints about your communication skills but we now expect practical action on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Madam President Commissioners ladies and gentlemen it is evident that the Commission is pressing on with the policy that deeply divided European society last year Were the riots in the suburbs of Paris not warning enough Having seen them we in Europe surely cannot continue with a policy that writes off some members of our society How having had this experience is it possible that the Commission should seek in the new work programme to address social issues quite separately from the growth strategy Why is it abandoning the former consensus according to which social inclusion policy was part of the Lisbon Strategy and hence an expression of social cohesion P Are we in future to have a state of affairs in which everyone will no longer be allowed irrespective of where they live or of their social status to share in Europes economic successes and in its prosperity Our group does not accept such a thing It does not accept that people such as those in the banlieues of Paris should no longer be allowed to benefit from Europes strategy for prosperity for a policy of social division will demand a high price from all of us P The work programme lamentably perpetuates this general trend As well as the onesided Lisbon Strategy the Gothenburg strategy is also to be treated in isolation with economic growth being treated as having higher priority than sustainable development in what is a completely backwardlooking policy that represents the selling out of our living resources and amounts to writing off our rural areas thus abandoning the interconnection of our economic social and environmental goals P How does the Commission justify using earmarking within the structural funds as a means of taking money away from territorial cohesion and sustainable development for all regions and making policy only for prosperous cities and thriving economic hubs while many European regions the young people in the banlieues and their counterparts in rural areas are treated as less important P That will not do Sustainable development must be brought back to the heart of European politics Madam President on behalf of the Committee on the Environment I thank our Commissioners for the work we do with them often constructive often with great thought often with what I hope is constructive criticism I say to the Commissioners that we look forward to what they are going to be doing in the coming year although perhaps I could start with what they are not going to be doing because it would be helpful to hear from them again a new list of steps that they are not going to take We have had the first tranche of that as part of the Lisbon Agenda We would like to know a little more about where the Commission is pulling back so that it can concentrate on the things that really matter P Linked to that in terms of better legislation we look forward to the development of environmental and health impact assessments in such a way that they are seen to and really do contain an element of independent assessment I would suggest that we need a panel of independent experts not a new building or agency but people on whom we can call to help to ensure that the impact assessments are effective I believe we would also want to ensure that the agencies for which we are responsible are efficient and effective There are some key ones in health medicines and food safety which need sustaining They are mostly new ones and doing good work I would like to see prioritisation between agencies as well as good support for those that we cover We would want to see proper enforcement as well So perhaps the package is to do less than we have done in the past but to do what we do even better P In our committee we look to the work in the health sector We have seen that prosperity is not an alternative to wellbeing Healthy people and a healthy environment are prerequisites for healthy economic growth competitiveness and jobs We want to see more work to improve health promotion collaboration between health services not only on patient mobility patient safety and the new areas of mental health but also on continuing areas such as flu preparedness P The environment goes handinhand with growth and jobs Ecoinnovation is a major component in winning the fight against global warming I certainly call on the Commission to lead initiatives in the postKyoto process outside the European Union developing the green diplomacy concept P Having recently been in Gaza and seen the devastation to people in the hospitals there we urge that with the new opportunities coming from the appointment of the new Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority the European Union should work closely with that authority and the Israelis to stop what is happening in Gaza and to promote real reconciliation and peace FR The legislative programme before us today is just a quiet renewal of the programmes for previous years Even so I find it quite remarkable that the Commission has not said a single word on two major reforms on which it is currently working namely the review of the financial perspective and the midterm review of the common agricultural policy These are politically very difficult issues but we cannot just ignore them The fact that the constitutional budgetary and agricultural debates are all taking place in 2007 means that the institutions really need to prepare themselves P With regard to the reduction in administrative costs set out by the Commission the vision of European policy that underlies it is in general very simplistic and pennypinching it is a shortterm vision from which our political priorities will suffer Instead we should reconsider whether the resources particularly in terms of staff provided to the Commission are adequate for the implementation of the policies we are seeking to promote P True the solutions proposed by the Commission in its citizens agenda are based on the idea of a proactive political programme targeted at the needs and expectations of Europeans Unfortunately though I cannot now find in this document any specific or new proposals for how to achieve the objectives of this programme The same is true of the Lisbon Strategy which we are told has been relaunched I cannot share your optimism Finally let us not forget that every year the overall budget allocated in fact contradicts the document that you are presenting to us today and distorts the political will demonstrated and voted on by our Parliament Does this document today not ultimately come down to words and pious hopes FI Madam President Commissioner our competitiveness and prosperity depend on our ability to develop sustainably Research and innovation are therefore essential New energy efficiency technologies such as hydrogen fusion LED light and solar and wind power are important for example Energy consumption in Europe is growing even though it should be falling We cannot live like this The high cost of energy hits the poorest In my view the Commission should establish a social programme for the supply of energy for our poorest citizens P It is said that without solidarity there will be no Union I suggest introducing a barometer to gauge solidarity throughout the EU In addition to the results of opinion polls and internal market infringement proceedings Eurostat and the Commission should publish a wider comparative evaluation of the Member States We need to find out openly and simply and in comparative format to what extent countries are fulfilling their promises in other words how much solidarity there is between us The schemers should be penalised Is the publication of a solidarity barometer appropriate and necessary What does Commission VicePresident Wallström think It might at least help the public understand better what is going on It is important that we get the framework programme on research and development through and certain other programmes as well P Applause ES Madam President I wished to stress how strange it is that there are no concrete legislative proposals for a common policy such as the Common Fisheries Policy The fact that the Commissions document takes a very horizontal view of the priorities cannot be used as an excuse for the lack of commitment to a policy which furthermore is at a crucial moment both internally and internationally P Fishing management is going to be affected it already is by a whole series of measures programmes and policies that respond to the Unions very diverse commitments within the framework of the Law of the Sea the Johannesburg Summit sustainable development environmental strategies climate change and biodiversity amongst other things Within this context the Commissions general attitude to the fisheries policy is marked by a surprising lack of legislative activity a lack of political impulse and lack of ambitions and commitments in the face of these challenges P Legislative activity in the field of fisheries is increasingly focussed on routine matters and minor daytoday modifications and on the rare occasion when the big outstanding issues are dealt with they are dealt with by means of mere communications with no legislative weight as in the case of discarded catches or which come extremely late as in the case of ecolabelling or which are at risk of fading to nothing like the proposal on the Mediterranean P This gives the impression that faced with the challenges I have mentioned the fisheries policy has chosen to remain at the lowest possible level and allow itself to be led by the priorities of other policies ignoring the fact that fisheries has a lot to say P Madam President in order to deal specifically with certain matters which remain outstanding and which are extremely urgent we would call upon the Commission to make immediate rigorous and coordinated legislative proposals on undeclared and unregulated illegal fishing P Internal affairs on behalf of the PSE Group FR Madam President up to now Europe has stuck to developing measures to combat illegal immigration It has tried to project the image of fortress Europe The Commission is going to make two decisive proposals with regard to the immigration of manual workers and of highly skilled workers P We are absolutely opposed to accepting undeclared exploited workers We therefore also need to provide legal immigration routes for people looking for work The plan is for the European Parliament simply to be consulted but we would like to obtain commitments so that we can be fully involved and our voice can be heard in the discussions on these two decisive directives P We also welcome your proposal to set minimum penalties for employers who exploit immigrants by forcing them to work illegally P My group recently went to the Puglia region in Italy where hundreds of immigrants have been reduced to slavery on agricultural holdings As we are all aware this is not just an Italian problem the enslavement of thousands of people is a problem throughout the European Union We are therefore calling for common provisions to protect immigrants rights in work for uniform penalties for exploiting illegal labour and for support for employers who regularise the status of their workers Thank you on behalf of the ALDE Group Madam President two years ago the European Parliament gave Mr Barrosos Commission the green light but only after he pledged to make fundamental rights a top priority However it seems that Mr Barroso who unfortunately is no longer here forgot his pledge the very next day because fundamental rights have disappeared altogether from the strategic objectives The work programme for 2007 lacks vision ambition and courage in this respect which is very cynical in the year of equal opportunities Better lawmaking is a good thing but we actually need more action on fundamental rights not less P Parliament has repeatedly called for a horizontal directive banning all forms of discrimination We called for urgent action against discrimination against homosexuals and against rampant homophobia None of this is in the work programme Why are human rights not the centrepiece of the Unions external policies P Security is indeed a priority but not the sellingout of democracy and civil liberties Measures are being taken in backroom deals that are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny or judicial review They are neither proportionate nor effective and citizens are increasingly defenceless against abuse and mistakes by the authorities Where are the Commission proposals addressing this issue and aimed at resetting the balance P Finally on democracy and transparency the Commission floated proposals for a European PNR policy and positive profiling at an informal gathering of ministers so how is it that these proposals do not feature in this official document And why is the Commission going along with the Council in informal gettogethers on security policy such as the ones on 16 August or with the US last week P I would very much like answers to those questions on behalf of the VertsALE Group NL Madam President my speech follows on seamlessly from what Mrs in t Veld said You may recall the exciting plenary debates that accompanied this Commissions appointment After all in his speech in which President Barroso asked for the confidence of this Parliament for his team he referred to the muchdebated nomination of Mr Buttiglione and he said and I quote P However one good thing will have come out of this unfortunate incident it has highlighted the importance we attach to decisive political action by the European Union in the fight against all forms of discrimination For this Commission civil rights and an antidiscrimination approach will be top priorities P NL A group of Commissioners that would mount concerted action against discrimination was said to be on its way and I should like to know how often this group meets what is on their agenda and what has in fact been achieved so far Why have you not yet floated any proposals as was suggested here a moment ago to raise the scope of the directive for equal treatment irrespective of sexual orientation religion or conviction age or disability to the level of the Race Directive since the latter does not only cover the labour market but also the provision of goods and services P After all could you Madam President perhaps explain to me why according to European guidelines a black heterosexual man may not be discriminated against when he applies for a loan from a bank or when he rents a house but a homosexual man to all intents and purposes can On 16 January Commissioner Frattini said that he wanted this straightened out but that the Commission would not propose it because it would not attain the required unanimity in the Council of Ministers P Well Madam President that is not leadership Will the Commission in future only make proposals if the Council is already in agreement This is the wrong way round in my opinion Moreover we should capitalise on the increased openness displayed by the Council of Ministers The Member States should own up to the fact that they are opposed to equal treatment Let a crossborder public debate take place on this subject because I would be interested to see whether Commissioner Wallström would agree with me that only then would Europe come nearer to the citizen P 2007 is the year of equal opportunities and it appears to me that as a result we have no time to lose Since the Commission has not yet done a great deal in this area I wanted to make the life of the European Commission a little easier I have already put a proposal for a new directive on paper on your behalf That way there will be no more excuses It is now up to Mr Frattini to translate Commissioner Barrosos fine words from October 2004 into action and I will presently hand the proposal for a directive to the Commission on behalf of the GUENGL Group IT Madam President ladies and gentlemen I note that the Commissions strategy has changed before we used to have such sound proposals now even these have disappeared President Barrosos speech leaves us very concerned In fact as regards the Commissions priorities for action in 2007 we feel that there is a lack of drive by the Commission to ensure that a practical common policy on immigration is launched Simply acknowledging that we need to marry security and solidarity does not strike me as a positive legislative principle for 2007 It seems a somewhat empty statement void of real meaning which does not contribute to building a genuine policy on legal immigration safeguarding economic immigration and abandoning the current prohibitionist approach that is leading more and more people to their deaths in the Mediterranean or in the Atlantic Ocean and is encouraging more and more migrants to arrive illegally on our territory and to remain here illegally P I believe that the Commission should provide real drive by proposing a policy on legal entry to our territory In my opinion it is not enough to state that security is a priority although this may well be true we also need to agree on what security means I believe that Europeans should be reassured of the fact that there will be no more illegal flights by the CIA in Europe that European citizens and asylum seekers will no longer be kidnapped and that the systematic checks on Europeans will be dropped I refer to SWIFT to PNR and to data retention P Therefore when discussing security I believe that first of all Europeans should be reassured that their rights are being protected I do not think that the Commissions efforts are heading in that direction on behalf of the INDDEM Group Madam President looking at the Commissions programme for 2007 I am struck not just by the new areas in which the EU seeks to strip more power away from my country and from the exEU slaves and eunuchs who run it but by the brief mention of the term constitutional treaty My submission is that the hidden agenda and programme for 2007 will include a resurrection of the constitution that slain vampire after a small blood transfusion The nationals of those countries who rejected it will be told to vote again because they did not understand that it was compulsory P The Commission hopes to obscure the principal issue namely its quest for legal personality or EU sovereignty Yet every year the EU takes more of the powers of nationhood P I object to the concept that British nationals are assumed to be in favour of all this power theft without being allowed to vote on the subject I also note a proposal from the Council to improve cooperation between EU police and security forces This contains a proposal about sharing information at European level including sharing with Europol This has been questioned and resisted before It is an infringement of the rights of British nationals some of whom already have an EU criminal record for planespotting My countrymen want an honest answer to the question of what the EU thinks it is and what happened to the concept of trade NL Madam President I should like to start by congratulating the Commission on its intention to reduce the administrative burden by 25 This is a very important objective and I would advise you to be as practical as possible in pursuing it P In the Netherlands we have now managed to bring about a 25 reduction but communication with businesses and citizens has resulted in continued complaints about far too much bureaucracy The citizens and businesses did not feel much of the effects because the reduction was mainly at macro level At micro level however bureaucracy persists I can think of a very simple way of solving this problem for example by raising the bottom threshold in public tenders P I live in a village of 25 000 people where a new swimming pool is being built that in accordance with European rules must be put out to tender with all the red tape that this involves Is this really necessary or could we not raise the lower limit a little so that it is only really important projects where real international competition is needed that fall under this rule P Turning to impact assessment we in the European Parliament have repeatedly demanded this and that it should be comprehensive including fresh legislation comitology that affects citizens and businesses and soft law After all an increasing number of issues are being regulated using soft law which may trigger an administrative burden of its own P Secondly we have repeatedly said that we would like the quality of this impact assessment to be subject to an independent review So far we have seen a great deal from the Commission in this respect but none of it was satisfactory We want this independent review since this can also generate more transparency It is of course a step in the right direction that this should under Mr Barrosos presidency be brought within the Commissions remit but since there is no transparency within the Commission I fear that we will be waging a bureaucratic trench war between the office that falls within Mr Barroso remit and the Commission offices that are required to draw up the impact assessment DE Madam President I have taken the liberty of carrying out a brief statistical analysis of the Commission work and legislative programme and have counted 57 nonlegislative acts and only 37 of a legislative nature so it would appear that the vast majority are nonlegislative and that strikes me as confirming a trend that has made itself clearly visible in recent times that being that the Commission is more inclined to take refuge in nonlegislative acts such as Green Papers White Papers communications and so on thereby in part circumventing its own legislature P It is clear to me that soft law instruments appear at first sight at any rate to fit better into the better regulation agenda but it has to be said that such instruments are neither enforceable nor binding and will end up as sources of even more disappointment for the public and for businesses P I would like to highlight on the basis of my own working experience a number of things that I find lacking in the work and legislative programme namely initiatives that the Commission has promised in other contexts but are not to be found here such as the standardisation of the consumer protection acquis the term of protection of copyright further developments in patent law and the applicability of EU law in sport The ECJ has produced a new ruling that fundamentally changes the position in this area and makes for greater legal uncertainty in it P Together with the first batch of initiatives to be withdrawn the statute for mutual societies and the statute for a European law governing associations went back as well and in the debate at that time VicePresident Verheugen promised us that this would be reviewed and consideration given to the possibility of improved initiatives in this area but I cannot see them here perhaps they are not regarded as having high priority It is a matter of complete indifference to me whether they are or not what matters to us is that we should know whether or not to expect their appearance DE Madam President there are two points in this work programme that I want to say something about one has to do with basic freedoms and the other with civic participation in the European Union Reference has frequently been made in this debate to the problem inherent in the lack of any preferences or priorities on the part of the Commission in the field of basic freedoms and third pillar a problem that we need firstly to address as a matter of urgency before secondly establishing the cause of the lack of political will P Reference has been made to the fact that Mr Barroso at the beginning of this legislative period set up a working party made up of Commissioners and tasked with addressing the issue of basic freedoms I find myself wondering what this working party has been up to over the last two years since no report has been forthcoming So have they been doing nothing Drinking coffee In all seriousness though we must if we are to take this subject seriously know what is to be discussed in this context P What I find worthy of criticism about this work programme is the fact that in parallel with the efforts by G6 states to do something about legal migration and by the few states gathered around the Federal Republic of Germany that have launched the Prüm Convention parallel structures are developing into a third pillar outside the third pillar without the Commission whose role as guardian of treaties is about more than making laws intervening or making any kind of forthright public comment The fact is that if we are to act on the judicial and police cooperation front we have to do so within the framework set for us by the Treaties P Since my time is running out I will conclude with a brief point which is that on page 10 of the programme on civic involvement is written in English the following and I quote P This includes a commitment to listen and to deliver P DE We have done so We have handed one million signatures to the Commission and the Council concerning the seat of Parliament Twoandahalf months on we have yet to receive a reply I believe that as far as listen and deliver is concerned the ball is now in the Commissions court EL Madam President one of the main measures for 2007 is border control This will be achieved with the second generation Schengen information system the VIS the operation of Frontex broader use of biometric data and the creation of central databases P The pretext for all this is the security of citizens and the management of immigrants entering the Union In reality however a European fortress is being created emphasis is being given to policies to stop immigrants protection notwithstanding and at the same time the creation of a police state is being served As regards collaboration between the public and private sectors in the field of security as proposed the question which arises is who will exercise control of the honest function of private individuals and how The possibility of intervention by private individuals with interests often politically controlled in the configuration and management of security policies is unsettling P Furthermore one of the Commission proposals refers to combating terrorist propaganda and the question we are asking is where are the limits of freedom of opinion set and who will set them politically and ideologically impartially when today liberating movements are condemned and political parties are called terrorist organisations Madam President I wish to begin by addressing the question of the internal market I think I am out of sequence because the internal market was discussed earlier by some of my colleagues However I want to welcome the review of the single market strategy on behalf of the members of our group I am pleased we are now focusing on the name single market because that describes much more accurately what we are working for We will therefore give the Commission a lot of support for that and indeed for other initiatives to make the single market work better P That leads me onto a broader concern I have on the work programme and the priorities as presented to us It is a big improvement on the one we had last year of which I was very critical and in which there was a very long list of unprioritised proposals We still have a long list of proposals I think there are 21 initiatives and as my colleague Mr Grosch said the difference between strategic initiatives and priorities is not entirely clear I would again make the point that a list of priorities longer than five is not a list of priorities at all P However I want to make the fundamental point that the issue of delivery which I am pleased to say is included is picturesquely described as delivery a daily task as if it were a routine issue we still have daily milk deliveries in England and I am pleased to say in pint bottles However it is not a routine issue but a fundamental one I really want to know what resources the Commission is putting behind the implementation of its policies On the single market we know that Mr McCreevy estimates that 90 of the legislation is already in place Delivery is fundamental Where does it say what resources the Commission is putting behind its initiatives Where does it say what resources the Commission is putting behind a transposition plan for the Services Directive we will approve tomorrow which is a fundamental piece of work If the Commission does not put the resources behind it it will not be delivered P I should like to ask Commissioner Wallström whom I understand is responsible for communication for the next package to be grouped together I do not want to see the single market policy scattered throughout this document I want to see the priority for the single market set out with the actions next to it the delivery resources next to that and the Commissions simplification plan next to that and I want all this to be lumped together with the percentage of resources the Commission is putting behind it That would be a logical and clear document and clear communication P Finally on the Services Directive I am delighted Mr Schulz is here because I note from a press release he issued today that the Services Directive is an enormous success for the Socialist Group Well colleagues on this side of the House it is an enormous success for this Parliament and all of us working together I hope people will have the humility to accept that However I notice that he has finally joined our liberal club because the release states that he supports the flexibility necessary to enterprise and the promise of new job creation Welcome to the market liberalisation club Mr Schulz DE Madam President 2007 will certainly be an important year in terms of whether citizens are won over to Europe or whether they continue to distance themselves from it P I should like to make three comments on this The first is that the Berlin declaration represents a good opportunity for us to demonstrate the idea of Europe and the European project I hope that this declaration concentrates on the future rather than focusing too much on the past Europe has its origins in the field of energy and this same field may also present a vision for the future if for example a largescale energy project were proposed that met all the criteria we are aiming at I am thinking here of the solarhydrogen economy which would be a real challenge for this continent and even for the international community P The second is that we need to make progress with the constitutional process This is the responsibility of the Presidencies of course but also of the other institutions I hope that the Commission does indeed provide input to show citizens what they stand to lose if the Constitution is not ratified and that it also makes proposals for overcoming the crisis The June Summit spoke of additional elements that need to be developed and I hope that 2007 sees the Commission too proffering some thoughts about what that means in practice P The third Madam VicePresident concerns democratic infrastructures We have European citizens initiatives One million signatures must not go to waste I think that we need a framework for how the institution receives mass petitions such as this These are important tasks for 2007 PL Mr President it was with real pleasure that I welcomed the points of the last two parts of the programme presented that is to say the part containing strategic initiatives and priority strategies It specifically addresses communication and I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for preparing this unusually important section particularly in 2006 as 2007 is to be a crucial year In 2007 internal reforms will have to be undertaken and preparations made for constitutional reforms primarily geared towards the introduction of the European Constitution P However I fear that the Commissioner was left without support here and that the Commission does not attach sufficient attention to this area and is not giving her sufficient assistance in the preparations needed for reforms even though they are her own I would like to ask the Commission what it has done to enable it to operate under new conditions in 2009 under a new treaty and will there be a greater number of commissioners or not P The final matter I would like to raise are the internal affairs of Europe which should be a better and safer place for all of our citizens to live This is the expectation of all citizens of the European Union but the citizens of the new Member States are in a less favourable situation They have fewer rights in many areas and are discriminated against in areas such as crossborder travel where the SIS and Schengen are concerned and I would like this element to be eliminated If this fact were eliminated we would no longer be discussing forced labour camps in Europe P Foreign Affairs on behalf of the PPEDE Group NL Mr President whilst I should like to thank the Commission warmly for this communication I have to start with somewhat more worrying observations I deeply regret to have to say that a clear development standpoint is what is lacking in the Commission communication I should like to remind you of the three objectives of the European Development Policy as described in the Treaty namely sustainable development the fight against poverty and the gradual integration of the developing countries into the global economy Although these deserve a special mention in the communication they are not there P In addition I should like to appeal to the Commission to tackle the problem of the relationship between other areas of policy and development policy more effectively I am particularly thinking of the relationship with fisheries trade and migration This is an important criterion in order to be able to achieve our own development goals and also to make a meaningful contribution towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals which we all agreed upon P Finally I am appealing to the Commission to include in the list of priorities communications in the following areas the latest with regard to the EUs contribution to the development goals secondly any headway made in European development policy with regard to the WTOs development round and thirdly the implications of the Commission proposal on more highly educated immigrants on the brain drain in developing countries Finally particularly the absence of the Millennium Development Goals and the fight against poverty are striking and disappointing in the paragraph that describes Europe as a global partner on behalf of the PSE Group FR Mr President I would first of all like to congratulate the Commission on having attached a high priority to a communication policy and in particular on having already implemented it within Parliament I can say that with regard to foreign affairs we are now in constant constructive contact with the Commission P However this just adds to the consternation with which we look at the Commissions programme on foreign policy and human rights In my view communications in this regard have been elliptical and almost subliminal There has been radio silence on the Mediterranean So what has happened to the spirit of Barcelona and the concept of an alliance of civilisations Little or nothing has been said on policy towards Africa beyond the development policy and you have been very tightlipped regarding Latin America even at a time when the European Parliament is involved in establishing Eurolat Last but not least there has been absolutely no reference to our human rights policy even though it is our brand image for the outside world and even though we have just managed to obtain a specific instrument for it In this regard it is worth bearing in mind that the conclusion of the action programmes with Israel Moldova and Ukraine is going to result in difficult negotiations about which the communication has nothing to say P Finally foreign policy as presented here seems to be based more on the European Unions bilateral relations with certain countries than on a regional policy or a policy of great communities It is all rather lacking in ambition attractiveness and life and that is a great shame for the people of Europe on behalf of the ALDE Group Mr President 2007 will be the key year for us all to find our own way to escape from the constitutional crisis and I am very pleased to hear from President Barroso that he plans for the Commission to play a central part in that exercise P The Commission strategy for change across the policy spectrum must be framed inside a constitutional context Policy reform will be given practical effect by its connection with the issues of the EUs competences the instruments the powers and procedures As far as external affairs are concerned for example the Union needs its legal personality Public opinion supports the EU as a global actor We need success on completing the Doha Round for trade and development We should be stalwart in persevering with enlargement despite the problems that we experience at present some of which at least are clearly foreseen and foreseeable P The Commission and Parliament must be steadfast to support the deployment of so many European forces not least at present in South Lebanon as this exercise surely provides the greatest test for the development of our common foreign security and defence policy on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen as foreign and security policy coordinator for the Group of the GreensEuropean Free Alliance I should like to make a number of critical remarks P A few points have been raised Mrs De Keyser expressed exactly what I feel when she questioned where we stand We can see the arc of crisis over Iraq Iran Libya the Middle East Europe a global player makes professions yet comes up with a static work programme consisting of on the one hand a banal statement of the problems devoid of political substance and on the other instruments that those of them that are actually new the Commission does not even acknowledge as a quantum leap P At this point I should like to express our disappointment that the five new externalpolicy instruments that are due to enter into force as of 1 January and that will support the Commissions external policy civil conflict prevention crisis management and reconstruction work for the first time are not given due attention but instead constitute just a single indent in the work programme P Then there is the Commissions concept of neighbourhood policy The Commission must clarify in political terms what it means when people now talk of neighbourhood policy light A political definition is no longer being given for this Any old words are being used and I have the impression that a political definition is virtually being avoided P I should like to finish with a positive comment I welcome the fact that the Commission is tackling the defenceequipment market at long last it is just that what the programme has to say about this it has been saying for years Parliament has given the green light and awaits results at long last Consequently I am afraid we are not satisfied in this regard on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President the European Union has done much to raise its visibility in the world arena in recent years In order to enable this process of emancipation to develop we have to face up to significant problems Since the enlargement of 2004 we are neighbours with a very troubled part of Europe to the east where in recent years we have seen Russia return to a policy of coercion in respect of its neighbours countries which today are also neighbours of the European Union Often these countries such as Georgia and Ukraine are included in our neighbourhood policy which the Commission rightly believes should be strengthened P However a successful reform of financial aid instruments is not everything In order to play an important role in the world particularly when we think of the European Union as a soft power takes credibility This credibility is a vital test and we cannot be a global or even regional player if we do not protect Belarus from annexation by Russia something which may only be a matter of months away P We will not become a global player if we trade human rights in Russia for gas or if we close the door to the proEuropean democratic and prowestern policies of Ukraine and Georgia in a cowardly way These are key objectives for our instruments in external policy If we do not succeed in using them successfully the world will see a growing gap between our often moralising declarations and the reality The world does not need such a European Union and the world would certainly have little respect for such a European Union Mr President how is 2006 ending What is our foreign policy We saw it in Finland the other day We are cursing Russia and caressing Turkey That is the reality We are cursing Russia with whom we have an energydependent relationship and we are caressing Turkey which says provocatively I am Turkey and can impose whatever I choose on Europe As you see it is insisting that we talk with it at a time when it does not accept the 25th Member State of the European Union Cyprus That is our policy We do not see what is happening in Gaza When at long last will the European Union see what is happening in this area of the world where children are being killed every day There have been about 500 000 deaths in Iraq When will we take an initiative at long last When there have been a billion deaths P So what is Europe Europe is on the American car carrier which drives us wherever it wants Fine we have handed them the steering wheel but let us at least take over the brakes so that we count for something Otherwise we are no more than servants of the foreign policy of America which drives us where it wants when it wants P What are our relations with China Do we know Are they hostile Are they friendly How do we address this factor A SinoRussian axis is developing What will we be The ham the salami in the sandwich which the United States of America wants to fix Let us decide on a foreign policy of our own Let us draw up our own policy We cannot see it anywhere We cannot see Europes policy anywhere We follow Americas policy and I do not think that it leads in the right direction to proper democratic developments P Applause Mr President as coordinator for the PPEDE Group I would like to stress the following points P We realise the importance of the external competitiveness aspects of the Lisbon Agenda and the coordination of internal and external actions and we reiterate our commitment to the multilateral approach in trade policy and support for the WTO as the principal forum for the management of globalisation We therefore deplore the suspension of the WTO negotiations and strongly urge the Commission to come forward and fight for a settlement on the Doha Round in 2007 P We welcome the EU communication on global Europe competing in the world We stress however that bilateral regional agreements should remain supplementary as I said to the multilateral trade system But here I have real concerns and I would like to question the Commission on this particular point Why have we not made progress with the USA on regulatory issues between the EU and the US by completing the transatlantic single market We must make a commitment to that over the next decade We cannot have a freetrade agreement with the US that would undermine multilateralism But we can have an agreement on regulatory issues which are outside Article 34 P Finally something that is particularly close to my own heart there is grave concern over the growing feeling of protectionism and trying to set goals that are outside the Lisbon Agenda Member States are increasingly using protectionist methods If we are going to have a settlement we have to move away from that P Finally I have serious concerns about EPAs and economic partnership negotiations and I support the Commission in its proposal We must go ahead with it and push it forward It is a real chance probably the last chance we are going to have to do something to help those poor countries If we can get an agreement on that it will be a great thing I look forward to that in the coming year NL Mr President many citizens are sceptical about presentday Europe and its mission is ambiguous Too much money is being spent on the old priorities such as agriculture while the new priorities the Europe of the future such as education migration policy and fair trade are being neglected Europe must be social not only inwardly but a social Europe is needed outwardly too Just like soft power a cohesive united Europe can make the difference in the world P We do not need unilateral actions like the invasion in Iraq but active commitment in Darfur with the help of the Security Council No relapse to bilateral trade agreements but a multilateral trade agreement in the World Trade Organisation that respects national public services such as water education social security or public housing No export subsidies that bring about unfair competition for Africa These hugely distorting agricultural subsidies and dumping must cease before 2013 The funds that are freed up as a result can be used for the development of regional agricultural markets in Africa P We must also open our markets for products with value added from those poor countries Aid and trade you are arguing in favour of sound initiatives for more coherence and coordination In the areas of migration agriculture and trade massive inconsistencies continue to exist These inconsistencies could seriously hamper the conclusion of the regional trade agreements that are currently being discussed On the subject of migration you emphasised the suppression of the problem but an effective solution to prevent the brain drain is absent Why not go for a Green Card initiative P Finally you have accepted the Development Cooperation Instrument DCI but no attempt is being made to streamline the Cotonou Agreement in the same way Also there is no energy or time for the real implementation in 2007 For national policy documents this involves consultation over there and over here It means working with public documents It means creating real ownership in the developing countries with the local NGOs the parliaments and governments Just as the DCI is deployed our Parliament here must be given real influence and control in the same manner P 2007 will be the year of truth for the Commission Will unilateral market thinking at European global level persist or will fair competition and solidarity prevail and will we Europeans prove to Africa that the Millennium Objectives are achievable after all Africa is going downhill 2007 should be the year of the Uturn P Closure of debate VicePresident of the Commission Mr President first of all my warm thanks on behalf of the whole Commission for all your important and constructive contributions to the debate on next years work programme which I have been listening to since 3 oclock My first comment will be a political one and then I would like to say something about the process But what I have heard is really a common call for sustainable development meaning that a majority of you have mentioned the need to create jobs and growth This is the start of the debate but we have to respect the most important resource we have people and make sure that we have a social security and social protection system that reaches out effectively to all citizens P It has to be sustainable growth which means we have to take account of natural resources energy issues and environmental constraints That is exactly what sustainable development is all about making sure that we do it the European way ensuring that all these three elements are covered by an ambitious policy for jobs and growth in Europe P I have heard these calls for quality jobs and investment in education and innovation research and development As you know this has been part of our political agenda from the first day of the Barroso Commission P We propose to respond to this because it is totally in line with this Commissions political ambitions and we propose reforms in this work programme We propose social cohesion and I think it is important to mention in that context since there was also a debate about regional policy that we now have in place all we need budgets regulations etc for a regional policy for 2007 to 2013 and that we are negotiating right now with Member States on the programmes P We hope for close cooperation with Parliament on implementation The urban dimension is taken very seriously by the Commission The earmarking takes account of the needs of both more and less advanced regions in Europe because there have been references to unfair cohesion policy and we say that all three dimensions of cohesion must be taken seriously This is also reflected in the new regulations where partnership is in principle obligatory and 82 of the structural funds goes to poorer regions Investment in people is one of the three objectives of the cohesion policy and I think that point should come out in the debate P We are also proposing security measures Security includes making sure we can live free from terrorist threats and crime and from environmental pollution We say we need to approach this with a lot of optimism and in partnership with all the stakeholders involved but engaging with Member States P This has to do with the issue of soft law Many of you have mentioned soft law compared with other measures and legislative acts It is important to mention that this Commission work programme for 2007 contains 34 legislative proposals representing 36 of the total 57 nonlegislative proposals and one negotiating mandate That is more than last years 24 legislative proposals 57 nonlegislative proposals and five negotiating mandates This figure shows that the proportion of legislative initiatives has increased from 27 to 36 At the same time the proportion of nonlegislative proposals has slightly decreased P With a more diverse Europe we also have to invest more in working with Member States to ensure that we prepare for good and better regulation and legislation that will be implemented Therefore we need better consultation and betterprepared proposals in order to see better results and that also applies to working methods P Mr Harbour asked about resources In some cases perhaps the Commission should ask the European Parliament to give us the resources we need As you know at the moment we are discussing how we can have enough resources to do everything Parliament has put on its wishlist I have heard so many proposals for things that ought to be added to the list and things that you have missed initiatives or legislative proposals that should be on this list energy initiatives migration initiatives the single market review the social reality stocktaking the emissions trading scheme a European strategy for social services a Community framework for efficient health services etc These 21 strategic objectives cover exactly the three pillars of sustainable development If we are to add more of these initiatives or more work we also need the resources and we cannot pretend otherwise We are concerned about the budget for the Commission We have to explain to our auditors the European Parliament and the other institutions how we use our money However we can discuss the structure until the cows come home but in the end we have to choose and we have chosen to make this a more political document and explain the priorities of the Barroso Commission P The different structure you propose makes a lot of sense but I think this is the way to ensure we can have a real political debate about priorities That has been our wish from the beginning in engaging with the European Parliament to discuss the work programme This reflects the kind of dialogue we have had with the European Parliament for a long time with contributions from all the individual committees I think I am speaking on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we have welcomed this and have enjoyed that debate and interaction with the European Parliament P I would also like to say that when several of you ask for things that you feel are missing that is in a way the tip of the iceberg So much is being done all the time in the Commission and our departments Here you find the strategic objectives the strategic initiatives that we say we will give priority to At the same time there are a number of things in the pipeline You are right on that point Mr Harbour you have to decide to give priority to a number of them You will also find a list of communication priorities That is in response to some of the very important remarks on human rights and antidiscrimination P As you know next year will be the Year of Equal Opportunities That is one of our communication priorities on which we will definitely engage with the other institutions Whether or not there should be a directive will be debated constantly with the European Parliament but we can only present directives when we are ready and the circumstances are right That will be debated later with the different committees Antidiscrimination and human rights are part of everything we do and clearly a political priority in all our activities P We welcome your contributions I find in your comments support for the high ambitions that the Commission has for 2007 and I also welcome your firm support to work together to achieve them We are also committed to listening to citizens and to delivery to becoming more accountable transparent and effective We thank you for your support in pursuing and strengthening our efforts towards better communication P Now the Commission will study the content of the resolution you will be adopting in December The Commission will respond in the most appropriate and timely manner The presentation of the annual policy strategy for 2008 could be the moment when the Commission explains how it intends to take account of the resolution on the work programme P I should like to reiterate that the Commission attaches the greatest importance to our framework agreement It has proved a solid basis for productive working relations between our two institutions It should remain our common objective to make the best use of it P Mr Duff we meet regularly in discussions about the constitutional treaty and as you already heard from President Barroso we have great hopes also for next year We shall now start preparing to move the institutional issues and hopefully the constitutional treaty forward next year We will have to work with Member States and engage in a dialogue with them as to how we can do this in a balanced and effective manner But it is clear that the problems addressed by the Constitution have not gone away They are there and accentuated by next years enlargement That is why we have to come back to the issue We have to engage in a debate However it has not been a detour to say that we also have to have a period of reflection and that we have to engage with citizens That has given us a lot in return It has been necessary because we can see a change of debate and atmosphere in many Member States It is important to know that we can mobilise that support in trying to find a solution to the constitutional issue The debate is closed P The vote will take place during the December partsession P The sitting was suspended at 610 pm and resumed at 630 pm",

    "input": "Gambling and sports betting in the Internal Market debate The next item is the Oral Question to the Commission by Arlene McCarthy on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on gambling and sports betting in the internal market B604432006 author Mr President I am not the author of the question but the Chairperson of the committee that is taking the question forward on behalf of Members I want to stress that the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection took a unanimous decision to table this oral question to ask the Commissioner for an update regarding the ongoing infringement proceedings against nine Member States concerning restrictions imposed on sports betting markets P The committee would like the Commission to tell us in particular what progress has been made on the infringement proceedings launched on 4 April 2006 and what future steps are planned in this area Is the Commissioner considering a legal framework for online gambling P As we are on the brink of agreeing the Services Directive we are well aware of the need for Member States to fulfil their Treaty obligations under Article 49 as regards the free movement of services The Commissioner will be aware of the committees decision to remove gambling services from the Services Directive not least because of the complexity of the gambling market However the freedom to provide services has in the case of the gambling sector clashed with national law in a number of Member States which have introduced restrictive laws limiting the crossborder supply of online betting and gambling services P We support the Commission in ensuring that these laws are compatible with Article 49 while respecting the rights of Member States to protect the public interest as long as the rules are necessary proportionate and nondiscriminatory ie not discriminating against other EU operators It is hypocritical on public interest grounds for a Member State to prevent other EU online operators from entering a national market while at the same time allowing its own national online market to grow considerably while not applying those public interest rules That is the issue we hope the Commission will address P I would like to take the debate in a different direction I believe that we need an EU response to the challenge of the global online gambling market This is a market set to grow to a value of EUR 20 billion by 2010 In 2003 in the EU25 commercial gaming industries lotteries and casinos and betting services were worth some EUR 515 billion and there are some 2300 worldwide online casino sites In the UK for example during the World Cup football matches 30 of those making online bets on UK services were women It crosses all classes and all generations The rapid growth of online services and remote gambling and betting services has de facto already erased national boundaries P However let us not follow the US model of pulling up the drawbridge by enacting the 2006 Bush legislation the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act making it a crime for banks to process or transfer funds via online betting sites This is simply protectionism hiding behind a smokescreen of the socalled protection of consumers against gambling excesses In reality it is a law to stop foreign operators from competing or undermining the US casino and gambling market while the States of Nevada and Las Vegas continue to develop their own online and remote gambling services P I believe it would be good if the Commissioner on behalf of the 25 Member States would engage in the campaign to get an international agreement on standards and rules in regulating eGambling This is one way to minimise the differences between not only the international community but also the EU Member States to ensure in the end that all states opt in to high standards both for operators and consumers The objective would be to ensure that we develop standards to protect vulnerable consumers in particular young adults and minors to engender a sense of social responsibility from good operators and investors and to ensure that gambling is not used as a source of crime or financing criminal activities P The internet genie is out of the bottle some 33 million EU citizens are regular online gamblers This is a market that will grow The EU should therefore be part of a wider international campaign for good and high standards We need greater international cooperation to curb problem gambling and more research into the extent of participation in remote gambling The study commissioned by the European Commission on gambling services in the internal market highlights the need to find common international standards and regulatory requirements that will protect EU citizens while allowing the market to operate P I hope the Commissioner will feel encouraged by tonights debate to continue with infringement proceedings However in reality it is a thankless task which takes years to resolve often not with a satisfactory conclusion and I believe the best way forward is for the EU now to be a leader driving good and high common international standards that can help minimise the differences protect consumers and force the operators to be socially responsible Member of the Commission Mr President gambling services are clearly services within the scope of the Treaty and Treaty principles including those on the freedom of establishment and the freedom of services apply to gambling The Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States legislation is fully compatible with the Treaty Therefore the Commission decided in April to ask seven Member States for more information on their legislation that restricts the supply of sports betting services The Commission has responded to a number of complaints from operators in the sports betting area P Having met with the authorities of all seven Member States my services are now examining the formal replies received from each At this stage I cannot preempt the outcome of that examination I should like to inform Parliament that I expect that to be completed in the next few weeks Based on that examination I would put forward a proposal to the college of Commissioners on how to proceed It would then be a matter for them to decide on the next steps P In addition to the seven cases opened in April the Commission decided on 12 October to send formal requests for information related to the gambling sector to three other Member States Complaints from operators to which the Commission is responding relate mainly to sports betting services That is why nine of the ten cases opened so far related to the provision of sports betting services some of them online However in October the Commission also enquired about national legislation in Austria which prohibits advertisements from casinos licensed and operating in other Member States We also have concerns that Austrian legislation requires national casinos to protect only nationals from excessive losses without having similar protection for foreign players P As guardian of the Treaty the Commission will examine all complaints that it receives However at the same time I do not underestimate the sensitivities that exist in many Member States on the question of gambling Member States are fully entitled to protect general interest objectives such as the protection of consumers However those measures must be necessary proportionate and nondiscriminatory In particular they must be applied to national and nonnational operators in a systematic and consistent way P The Commission does not seek to liberalise the market in any way but rather to be assured that whatever measures Member States have in place are fully compatible with existing EU law Member States are well aware of the case law of the European Court of Justice which I expect will develop further P The Commission accepted Parliaments request to exclude all gambling services from the scope of the draft Services Directive It was made quite clear to me at that time that the regulation of gambling should be left to the Member States I fully agree provided that such national legislation is compatible with the Treaty In the context of the infringement proceedings I am willing to work in close cooperation with the Member States to ensure compatibility of national legislation with Community requirements and allow for appropriate and effective protection to be put in place for example to safeguard consumers and to protect minors on behalf of the PPEDE Group Mr President would you allow me to make a point first before you start the clock According to the agenda this debate was scheduled to start at 1030 That was quite clear and I notice that a number of my colleagues made an effort to be here at 1030 So I am disturbed to find that I missed most of the speech of my colleague Mrs McCarthy because the debate appears to have started at least ten minutes early I do not think that is acceptable if I may say so and I am sorry that your predecessor in the Chair has gone away If the schedule for the day says a debate starts at 1030 I submit to you that it should start at 1030 even if there has to be a short adjournment P Perhaps I could now move on and if you will restart the clock please I shall make my substantive points P I very much welcome the fact that Mr McCreevy is here to address this issue and I am pleased that under the leadership of Mrs McCarthy we have taken an initiative that I hope will shed some light on this issue As the Commissioner made clear this is a highly sensitive issue and it involves many aspects of public interest But nevertheless from the point of view of the operation of the Single Market which is also of overriding interest to us the situation is as you suggested deeply unsatisfactory P Clearly we await the results of your investigations but I suggest that at the very least it would be appropriate for you to issue some form of guidelines to Member States on their attitude to receiving applications from reputable and wellestablished gambling operators who simply want to be able to operate in other EU countries under the law of those countries which they are perfectly entitled to do One of the things you did not mention but which seems to me to be rather extraordinary in terms of discriminatory practice is that some Member States have tried to restrict access to those markets on the grounds that they do not want to encourage gambling Yet at the same time those Member States are promoting participation in their national lotteries with billions of euros across Europe Clearly that is entirely inconsistent I believe it is sensible and good that the European Court of Justice has struck down some of the restrictions but I think those guidelines will be important As Mrs McCarthy said in terms of operation and protecting the public interest respectable operations are extremely important P The big issue that we have to face is online gambling Whether Member States want to preserve a monopoly or not the fact is that consumers are taking advantage of online gambling I believe it is much better in the public interest that we have wellregulated online gambling services than uncontrolled services which come into Europe from other countries outside the remit of the European Union Before giving the floor to the next speaker I am going to respond to a procedural motion P You are absolutely right the debate was indeed scheduled for the time that you indicated However it was explained on the European Parliaments website at the start of the afternoon that the debate could start slightly earlier if question time finished earlier than scheduled which was the case Furthermore the services tried to contact all of the speakers They managed to contact all of them except you Mr Harbour but I think that your presence in the Chamber this evening shows that you have not missed a great deal of the debate That being said I felt it my duty to explain the situation to you on behalf of the PSE Group IT Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen Rien ne va plus No more bets is the curious opening of the recent opinion delivered by the Advocate General Dámaso RuizJarabo Colomer to the European Court of Justice which had been asked to rule for the third time on Italian legislation on gambling following the Zenatti ruling and the Gambelli ruling the latter rightly referred to in the recitals of the oral question under discussion P It is truly important to be familiar not only with the Commissions findings but also with the recent measures by the Member States against whom infringement proceedings have been opened and specifically the steps that the Commission intends to take I believe that it is also important for there to be moderate but definite rules in this sector also involving the European Parliament directly That is the only way to help Member States exposed to the risk of appeals and negative judgments in what remains a worthy attempt to protect individuals in particular minors and the most vulnerable as has already been said P The explosion of gambling lotteries and online betting is a problem that cannot be left to market liberalisation even if the difficulty concerning the nondiscrimination principle is obvious I must just point out that the Services Directive which has already been referred to here excludes gambling precisely for reasons of public order and consumer protection on behalf of the ALDEDE Group NL Mr President I thank the Commissioners and my fellow Members for taking the trouble to discuss this topic which is after all an exciting one We have left gambling and Internet gambling outside of the Services Directive because we do not dare take a decision on it It still falls within the scope of Articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty and at the moment as is also evident from the 11 infringement procedures there is enormous legal uncertainty among the Member States and businesses How should we tackle it P I am pleased that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has put this oral question for the problems are after all real There is the problem that on the one hand it is very lucrative for the Member States in terms of tax revenue but on other hand it also brings with it social problems The main problem though is that if there is no sound legal framework in place within a market where serious money can be made this opens the floodgates to a huge number of illegal practices in which criminal organisations reign supreme P I therefore believe that the politicians and I hope that the Commissioner will agree with me on this must take up the gauntlet and dare take decisions We must not surrender ourselves to the very wise judges in Luxembourg who then have the onerous task of biting the bullet I fear that many more judgments from the European Court of Justice will follow as long as we as politicians do not take the right decisions P I hope that the Commission and the Council will get there in the end If not I hope that Parliament itself will produce an owninitiative report in order to guarantee legal certainty which is desperately needed given the many problems that exist including addiction public health problems illicit funds money laundering and the list goes on We must solve this with a firm clear directive on gambling and Internet gambling I hope that the Commissioner will advise us as to how Parliament should tackle this on behalf of the INDDEM Group Mr President I welcome the Commissioners statement that we must protect minors To do that it is imperative to take a long hard look at Irelands policy of having no age limit on gambling with the staterun tote Children in Ireland are permitted to place bets at greyhound tracks and horse tracks if these are part of that tote Other forms of gambling are limited to over18s Video evidence exists of Irish children as young as four years of age legally placing bets with the staterun tote It is not uncommon for birthday Christmas and first communion money to wind up in the Irish state tote and ultimately with the Irish Exchequer P The Chief Executive of Horse Racing Ireland when asked his opinion of child gambling in Ireland said that it was no problem and that he wanted to develop the customer of the future For years you Commissioner McCreevy as Irish Minister for Finance refused to amend the Tote Act and outlaw child betting in Ireland As Commissioner will you now change your attitude and at this late date support restrictions on child online betting at race tracks in bookmakers on airplanes and anywhere else that this insidious practice persists NL Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen from the very first vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection we decided to leave gambling activities including lotteries and bets outside of the scope of the Services Directive It may be that some as Mr Manders said a moment ago were frightened of taking a decision I am convinced that many felt that the Member States could be given quite a bit of freedom to handle this complex issue in their own way in tune with the sensitivities and the situations in their countries according to their own traditions P It goes without saying that in this respect the Member States should respect the Treaty and we already know the answer of the Court to a number of prejudicial questions that have previously been asked I hope Commissioner that the questions that are yet to be asked will not immediately prompt you to advise the Commission to start issuing rules and regulations Whilst the Commission is of course the guardian of the Treaties and we expect it to take its role seriously this can also be done with some restraint P Getting the internal market to operate is necessary and positive in every respect but this need not be at the expense of the effective protection of law and order security and the consumers mental health I hope there will also be room for the Member States which via state monopolies or not as the case may be commit to channelling the passion for gambling monitor the fairness of the game and to donate the financial gain as and when they can for cultural social and sports goals Clear legal rules can certainly help but legislation is not always the answer I am certainly not talking on behalf of the whole of the group but on behalf of a number of group colleagues who were unable to take the floor this evening ES Mr President gambling is not just another service it is a dangerous activity It is dangerous because peoples innocence and ignorance is being exploited In the majority of our Member States gambling is currently subject to regulation P I do not understand how it can be possible for supranational bodies now to be planning to impose a liberalisation of gambling services on the Member States when the majority of our societies do not accept it P The United States Congress recently banned online gambling and it seems to me that at the moment we should follow the US example in the European Union on the one hand in order to protect our consumers from mafia organisations and secondly in order to protect all those social institutions in each of the Member States that currently rely on legal forms of gambling permitted by national authorities P I therefore believe that the Commission is right to look into the issue of gambling but it must deal with it from the point of view of consumer protection and the protection of the institutions currently benefiting from legal gambling in the majority of our Member States DE Commissioner McCreevy has also had an extremely tiring day today and so he will understand our desire to present the matter to him with the necessary clarity and brevity P In my personal opinion gambling and the abundance of lotteries have two different elements On the one hand there is the truly crossborder market for online providers that can only be regulated at European level As Mr MedinaOrtega pointed out the US has already managed to regulate its market Europe too can resolve the issue of the online market only by joining with the Member States and introducing Europewide regulation P On the other hand there is the market in traditional games of chance and traditional sports betting which tend to take place in written form In contrast to the infringement proceedings opened by the Commission Commissioner McCreevy in other words we should proceed according to the principle that if the Member States are succeeding in preventing addiction effectively by orienting their national monopolies towards a range of services that is as limited as possible and offers the greatest possible consumer protection they should be given the chance to retain these monopolies in future under the control and auspices of European law and the European Commission P It must be ensured however that the monopolies that the Member States already have truly pursue just one objective namely the prevention of addiction and that Member States do not use them to pursue other objectives such as aiding the recovery of public finances or promoting sport P In this context I would be delighted if Parliament and the Commission together could agree on a regime that on the one hand establishes European regulation of the online market and on the other maintains the national regulations in the field of monopolies for traditional sports betting provided these are compatible with the internal market PT Mr President ladies and gentlemen the exclusion of gambling including lotteries from the Services Directive appeared to have introduced a measure of clarity to the sector but we need to go further We are aware of a number of complicated aspects involving certain types of gambling and betting It is therefore necessary to guarantee consumer protection and to ensure effective monitoring of the financial circuits relating to such activities in order to prevent or combat money laundering P Naturally we must not confuse the appropriate protection of the consumer with the undue protectionism that any particular Member State may want or may employ In any event however it should be pointed out that every Member State has the right to regulate the phenomenon of betting for money on its territory until such time as another Europeanlevel legal instrument appears In this regard online gambling deserves special attention from the Commission and immediately from Parliament as previous speakers have mentioned and as is clear from the debate Lastly I welcome the fact that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection raised this issue with the result that we have made some progress in clarifying it this evening FR Mr President I am going to try to be both quick and slow This report is timely and I might add that I consider the remarks made just now to be positive Everyone would like the European Union to intervene using methods other than simple caselaw This issue does in fact involve a range of businesses and services casinos lotteries and other games of chance via traditional means or via the Internet Therefore this goes far beyond simple online sporting bets which is the subject of Mrs McCarthys question P While it is normal for these services to apply the principles of the internal market Commissioner freedom should not go hand in hand with the law of the jungle For reasons to do with the general interest health morality and security these services need to be regulated and controlled The Member States must be able to authorise and control public and private operators in the context of fair competition The importance of crossborder games does however require us to go beyond the national framework In this regard the recent decision taken by the United States is the demonstration that if those who play and who make others play cannot be controlled then it is better to take too many precautions than not enough P That is why Commissioner I consider the Commissions current approach which is based exclusively on the Treaties and on the Court of Justice to be inadequate and dangerous It is clear today that the idea that the national laws are compatible with the Treaties is an unsatisfactory one Commissioner you must work alongside Parliament to establish complementary legislation that can organise this extremely important sector both politically and economically in a sound and rational manner Let this sector develop but let it do so in complete safety for the people and for the Member States EL Mr President over recent years the system of the state monopoly in the gambling sector which prevails in the majority of the Member States of the European Union has been on the receiving end of more and more attacks from mainly private interests P At the European Union summit in Edinburgh in December 1992 the European Council decided given the principle of subsidiarity not to regulate gambling and to leave it under the sole jurisdiction of the Member States The directive adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2000 makes provision for the express exemption of gambling from its scope The draft 2006 directive on services makes precisely the same provision Given the peculiarities of the gambling sector the Court of Justice of the European Communities acknowledges the competence of the Member States to regulate the gambling market in what they consider to be the best way possible P Mr President Commissioner one of the most important reasons for these decisions is the fact that there is a high degree of risk of addition inherent in the gambling sector especially of young people and of crimes being committed such as fraud money laundering and so on and I personally believe that only the state can create the control guarantee reliability and transparency mechanisms needed in order to protect consumers P Finally I am of the opinion that once the gambling market is liberalised the system of support for sports in Europe will collapse taking cultural and social actions and subsidies with it such as the fight against drugs education and support for people with disabilities or special needs who mainly have financial support from the state gambling organisation We believe in the free market but do not occasionally ignore the risks inherent in uncontrolled gambling DE Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen first of all for regulatory reasons we have exempted games of chance and casinos from the Services Directive I say this despite being a firm supporter of strengthening the internal market We did not want to throw the baby out with the bath water however P Secondly there are many risks associated with games of chance and so the argument regarding competition law and the internal market should not be the only one used by the Commission in support of infringement proceedings P Thirdly a clear definition is needed When we talk about games of chance what is covered by the term Given the differences in the treatment of online markets sports betting machines casinos and lotteries a single definition is needed to ensure these are dealt with the same way everywhere and a single legal framework is probably also required P Fourthly I should like to point out to the Commissioner that there are other important fields too to be taken into consideration such as consumer protection health taxation international trade the problem of money laundering the prevention of addiction and the fight against crime including organised crime P Fifthly almost all Member States regulate the field of games of chance Eleven have special legislative models and four use the limitedlicence model P Sixthly in 2004 state lotteries achieved sales of EUR 63 billion which is an average per capita net expenditure of EUR 140 P Seventhly that means that approximately 33 of all takings go on good causes and tax In the event of liberalisation of the private sector this would be just 3 P Eighthly it is estimated that the industry generates approximately 13 billion jobs in the EU P Ninthly the sale of lottery tickets accounts for 195 000 jobs within the EU P I would ask the Commissioner to consider these arguments when making his assessment Mr President I should like to make one point Much attention has been paid in this debate to young people and the effects of gambling addiction on them and yet more people under the age of 12 are trafficked or forced into prostitution because of drug or alcohol addiction and abuse than the gambling addiction that is the subject of our debate tonight Member of the Commission There is no specific Community legislation governing gambling If and how Member States wish to regulate gambling services at national regional or local level is therefore a matter for each Member State to decide for itself But the general principles of Community law and the Treaty continue to apply and any national legislation must respect those principles The diversity of national approaches can lead to legal uncertainty for service providers and their customers especially where national legislation fails to respect Community law P Tonights debate helps to illustrate once more the diversity of opinion with regard to gambling services I am of course aware of calls for a specific Community regulatory framework for gambling services There are equally strong views opposing such Community intervention In my experience the first requirement in trying to find a solution is to have a clear understanding of the problem and of the policy options available The Commission recently published a study carried out on its behalf by the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law The study illustrates the complexity and diversity of national regulatory approaches Should Parliament believe that over and above our efforts to ensure the application of fundamental Treaty principles more should be done to ensure legal clarity I look forward to hearing Parliaments detailed views on what precisely the issues are that warrant Community intervention and what policy options would command a sufficient degree of consensus for a meaningful solution at Community level In the absence of such a political consensus legal certainty may ultimately only be provided by the European Court of Justice P I should like to add just a few more words to this debate Mr Harbour put it fairly succinctly when he made the point that there was a great deal of inconsistency amongst many of the Member States against whom we are now taking some action We shall probably be taking action against some more If Member States their governments and their legislatures want to have very restrictive laws on gambling etc they may do so on public policy grounds But they cannot do the things that Mr Harbour has referred to They cannot spend millions and millions advertising gambling services for their own national operators or their own national publiclyowned operators They cannot allow their own national operators and bar everybody else If Member States feel as some Members of this House obviously do that gambling is a greater scourge than alcohol addiction tobacco addiction and all these other addictions put together then they should ban it for everybody and allow no gambling at all in their Member State That is one option Then nobody would complain The Commission would not take action against them and no one would worry about it at all But it is a bit hypocritical for Member States to allow millions to be spent promoting gambling and at the same time allow nobody else to play the game P In all Member States gambling is regulated to some extent The point made by Mrs McCarthy about international standards for online gambling is quite a good idea in itself but first some form of consensus would be needed among the 25 Member States We can start by getting consensus in this Parliament but I do not think we will I am certain that we will not get it in the Council of Ministers I have about the same chance of getting consensus in the Council of Ministers and Parliament as I have of winning the lottery this weekend Those would be the odds against it So there is much to commend what Mrs McCarthy says and if there was a consensus I would like to go in that direction but my experience tells me that it would be very difficult P If you read the executive summary in the recent study which if I am correct comes to 51 pages and save yourself reading the other couple of hundred pages it does not come down heavily on one side or the other P comments offmicrophone from Mr Toubon P Well I do not think my honourable friend Mr Toubon has read the report but you can see from that how complex this problem is and the many different ways it is regulated It will show you what a gargantuan task it would be to head down that road P In my political life I have not been afraid to take on impossible causes and tilt at windmills and run into brick walls but I think that if we did attempt some kind of harmonisation of this area what we would end up with if anything would be the most illiberal piece of legislation ever to go through any House anywhere in the world because it is not possible I have recognised for a long time that there are great differences of opinion here long before I came to this conclusion I recognise that throughout Europe and even in my home country there would be very different views about this Some people I know think that it is worse than drinking addiction worse than tobacco addiction worse than anything possible but others do not I know which category I fit into but I think trying to get some harmonisation in this area is going to be a long long process The debate is closed P Written statements Rule 142 MT Some Member States have unilaterally decided to introduce legislation preventing Europeans from using Internet gambling sites run by companies registered in other European Union countries P This violates the principle of unrestricted movement of services between Member States as well as Directive 9834 EC which stipulates that prior to introducing regulations concerning information technology services a state must inform all other Member States and the Commission P Last June in response to a parliamentary question I was informed that the matter was the subject of an investigation by the Commission P May we know the stage this investigation has reached and whether any measures have been taken P I agree that it is time this rapidly developing sector were governed by a legal structure that contained standards and regulations governing this service in a serious manner P These regulations would protect consumers and minors while at the same time permitting serious operators to work freely in all Member States of the European Union",

    "input": "Oneminute speeches on matters of political importance The next item is the oneminute speeches on matters of political importance P Many Members are listed but they will not all be able to speak I shall have to be strict about speaking times and I would remind you that Members who have spoken in either or both of the previous two sittings will not have priority Members that did not speak in either the sitting of 13 November or the sitting of 29 November will have priority SK As soon as the Commission announced last October that the free movement of citizens from the new Member States would be postponed until 2009 we voiced our objections in the European Parliament We also launched several initiatives including questions to the Council and Commission and we subsequently drafted Declaration No 72 which is still pending This declaration is designed to ensure compliance with the original deadline for accession to the Schengen area P For this reason I regard the decision taken last week on St Nicolas Day by EU interior ministers enabling citizens from the nine new Member States to travel freely within the European Union from 1 January 2008 as a great success of the European Union and a consequence of the intervention by the MEPs P Colleagues I would like to thank you for your support I am convinced that all countries including Slovakia will soon agree upon the strict security requirements involved in temporarily deploying an enhanced version of the current system as proposed by Portugal EL Mr President last week Turkey made a Diplomatic move by agreeing to open a port and an airport for trade with the Republic of Cyprus P Their timing was a bit odd considering that their move was made during the COREPER meeting However the Turkish proposal is nothing more than a clumsy unacceptable and provocative manoeuvre whose sole objective is to bypass the obligations undertaken by Ankara towards the European Union and its Member States Not only is Ankara persisting on essentially denying its obligations but also is arrogantly setting conditions aimed at gaining favours in Cyprus P Turkeys obligations towards the European Union are very specific and are not subject to bargaining Given these facts the European Union should reject without further consideration these so called Turkish proposals I believe that the European Union should unanimously reject this inappropriately provocative offer FR Mr President as I speak the trial of Mr Vojislav Seselj the chairman of Serbias main party the Serbian Radical Party is getting under way Mr Seselj surrendered voluntarily in January 2003 four years ago when the indictment against him was published The indictment referred only to speeches and a political plan to bring all Serbs together in a single country that may be questionable of course but we know what very painful circumstances that country has been through Mr Seselj has been held in solitary confinement since December 2004 for granting interviews to Serbian newspapers but the prosecutor Mrs UertzRetzlaff speaks against him in the press freely P Mr Seselj is demanding to see his family he should be entitled to do so and to appear freely He is demanding to correspond with the Tribunal in Serbian his native language which he is also entitled to do but is being denied that right As a doctor and professor of law he wishes to conduct his own defence which is a fundamental right He is refusing to accept lawyers appointed by the tribunal whom experience has shown to favour the prosecution What does Alphons Orie the presiding judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have to say about this I quote the court finds that the accuseds selfrepresentation P The President cut off the speaker ET Ladies and gentlemen yesterday Igor Smirnov who 15 years ago seized power with the help of the Russian forces in Transnistria had himself elected for another five years as the president of an illegitimate country The dictator who holds a Russian passport and was trained by the KGB claimed 80 of the vote P The election was organised by an illegitimate government on territory controlled by foreign military forces its result is null and void in terms of international law The Smirnov regime will not be made any more legal by the permission given to three weak opponents to take part in a contest the result of which was known in advance having been decided in Moscow during the summer Smirnovs only serious rival Mr Shevchuk the speaker of the Supreme Soviet of Transnistria withdrew his candidacy at the urgent request of the Kremlin P The European Union must continue to support Moldovas territorial integrity Our border assistance mission has proved successful where Russias de facto veto has paralysed the OSCEs effectiveness The greatest obstacle to the selfdetermination of the inhabitants of Transnistria is the presence of Russian forces We must urgently demand their departure EL Mr President Article 49 of the European Union Treaty which contains the accession clause to the European Union specifies the role of the Unions institutions According to the said article the Council is the body which decides on negotiations P I direct two questions to this Body and the present European Commission First on what legal grounds does the European Commission carry out European Union accession negotiations with candidate countries on behalf of the European Union Second is the European Commission authorised to express political opinions on critical issues for the selection or nonselection of a candidate country during interim nonetheless decisive stages of the negotiation procedure EL Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to bring to your attention the tragic development in the Middle East and the immediate need for swift and effective intervention We need to stabilise the region or at least prevent any deterioration which would have unforeseen consequences P Europe is not absent from that region It is present with its diplomatic action its development and humanitarian aid its corporate relations in the Mediterranean and its participation in peacekeeping forces However it did not manage to play an effective role and so we must look into it immediately because our hopes that military interventions will create a new Middle East with democracy and stability are not coming true Therefore we must look into a new intervention plan moreover I believe that the European Parliament can promote the relevant talks demanding results which will positively affect the prosperity of both the people living in the region and ourselves of course because whatever is happening in our neighbourhood should concern us Mr President I rise to speak because of my concern about the interference by Commissioner McCreevy in Irish politics last week where he made a public statement challenging the Irish Governments policy with regard to health insurance on the Irish market The area he is interfering in is not his responsibility he has responsibility for the internal market not for competition In addition to that the policy being pursued by the Government has been approved by the Commission and has recently been approved by the Irish courts P My only conclusion is that Commissioner McCreevy is assisting his former Cabinet colleague and friend Minister Harney in shifting her policy on health insurance and blaming Brussels for that shift in policy That is an unacceptable direct interference by a Commissioner in Irish political decisionmaking I would appeal to you Mr President to make those concerns known to President Barroso I will pass on to you the correspondence I have had on that matter with the President and with Commissioner McCreevy I shall communicate your points to Mr Barroso so that he can take the action he deems appropriate Mr De Rossa Mr President I apologise for not being here when you first called me P A number of years ago I along with other Members of this Parliament was involved when Europe provided funds for a study into having a ferry service between Ballycastle in County Antrim Northern Ireland and Campbeltown in Scotland The study was dutifully carried out proved to be good and the ferry service started and ran for a short time P The Scottish Parliament agreed to provide GBP 700 000 with the Northern Ireland Executive being prepared to provide GBP 300 000 making a total of GPB 1 million as a seedling grant to get the service up and going Now we find that while the Scottish Executive is prepared to honour its position and to pay the money up front the directrule minister Maria Eagle is refusing to honour her side of the agreement That is totally unacceptable and wrong I have raised this with the Secretary of State and with Commissioner Barrot and I want to pursue it as far as possible I see that the Irish bench is waking up Mr President I want to bring to the attention of the Commission and if possible try to get a resolution about a difficulty that Irish fishermen are facing at present because of an inflexible interpretation of the 100 kilometre rule which means that fish must be landed and processed within a 100kilometre range The difficulty is that a lot of the processing capacity in Ireland is not exactly on the shore or on the docks but further inland This creates difficulties in terms of transportation since road transport counts as part of the 100kilometre range P I ask Commissioner Borg to look very carefully at that issue and give us a more flexible interpretation of the rule both to allow what is a very successful Irish fishing industry to continue and because it has an impact not only on Irish catches but also on the ability of other boats operating in Irish waters to land their catches in Ireland This means they have to travel further use more fuel and are being forced to land their catches in other markets which may not necessarily benefit the European Union as a whole PL Mr President Turkey is under the mistaken impression that last Thursday it took an important step towards continuing negotiations with the European Union Opening one single airport and one single port to Greek Cypriots for a year is a joke and yet another example of Prime Minister Erdogans arrogant attitude towards Europe P Turkey is behaving as if the Union were wanting to join Turkey In fact it is the other way around Turkey is asking to join the Union If Turkey is doing the asking it must be because it considers our European civilisation based mainly on Christianity to be superior to its own or at least to be in some way desirable That being the case Turkey should comply with our conditions and not impose its own P Given this state of affairs something more than partial suspension of accession negotiations with Turkey is needed The negotiations should be completely halted Mr President I rise to draw attention to the continuing plight of the West Papuan people Just a week or so ago was West Papua Independence Day which is traditionally held on 1 December to mark the anniversary of the Dutch promise to grant independence to West Papua a promise originally made in December 1961 Of course that independence never came and instead there has been a continuing military occupation by Indonesia for over 40 years with torture disappearance detention without trial and murder of West Papuans at the hands of the military being commonplace P I am calling on you President as well as the Commission and Council to raise the issue of West Papuas selfdetermination with the relevant Indonesian authorities and for them to do all they can to ensure the withdrawal of the Indonesian military from West Papua and the holding of a free and democratic referendum on selfdetermination including all the indigenous West Papuans P A number of colleagues have put down a written declaration for this session to coincide with Independence Day for West Papua and I urge my colleagues here to cosign that written declaration Mr President as colleagues may be aware the Irish peace process is continuing to inch forward towards the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement including the restoration of the powersharing and allIreland institutions P The significance of the DUPs Ian Paisleys conditional yes to powersharing with Irish nationalists and republicans should not be underestimated However there is still a long way to go and many challenges lie ahead P It is now important that we get down to the very serious business of reestablishing the political institutions so that local people can make local decisions free from interference from unelected and unaccountable British Government ministers It is also important that the DUP begin the process of engagement with Sinn Féin to resolve other outstanding issues including that of policing I would encourage the EU to continue to show support for the process at this crucial time PL Mr President 25 years ago on 13 December 1981 martial law was imposed in Poland This led to the outlawing of the Solidarity trade union Essentially martial law involved the use of force repression and persecution against trade union activists scientists artists and indeed all those who refused to be enslaved by totalitarianism in Poland P Under martial law when Poland was ruled by General Jaruzelski violations of human civil and political rights were commonplace Over ten thousand individuals were either imprisoned or sent to internment camps during that period Many people laid down their lives in defence of Solidarity P On 16 December nine miners were killed as a result of the brutal dispersal of demonstrators at the Wujek mine by special units of the ZOMO Motorised Reserves of the Citizens Militia and 21 others were injured P I call on the European Parliament to pay tribute today to all those who fell in the cause of freedom and justice I refer to all the victims of persecution under martial law and to all those who refused to be subdued by the use of force and continued their independent activity thus contributing to the advent of freedom and democracy in Poland Mr President my constituent David Wilson was jailed in 2003 because illegal migrants had hidden in the back of his lorry at a Greek port He was charged and sentenced within 24 hours under a fasttrack procedure without sufficient legal advice with a local shopkeeper as an interpreter and without advice from the British Embassy P As he was totally innocent he was acquitted on appeal but not before suffering the horrendous ordeal of months in prison far from his family and the permanent loss of his job He never recovered from that and tragically took his own life last month P That tragedy would never have happened if the EUs framework decision on procedural rights and criminal proceedings for people charged in other Member States had already been in force That proposal would guarantee that anyone facing criminal charges abroad has access to their countrys consular services and is given qualified legal advice That was all lacking in his case P I would urge the Council to get a move on and adopt that proposal as a matter of urgency FR Mr President I want to express my disapproval at what Mr Kyprianou European Commissioner responsible for health and consumer protection said at a press conference on 9 November The Commissioner warmly congratulated four foodsector multinationals which I will not name on what they are doing to help fight obesity he also allowed them to promote themselves by setting up stands at the entrance to the room where the press conference was held P We must bear in mind that one child in five in Europe is obese and that this number is growing every year because of poor eating habits encouraged by the fast food fizzy drinks and chocolate bars marketed mainly by those four multinationals Binding legislation to provide European consumers with nutritional information would do them more good than eulogies addressed to companies that have contributed to the obesity explosion for decades There are other ways of fighting obesity eating more fruit and vegetables and taking part in sporting activities which ought to be better promoted P I can therefore only advise Mr Kyprianou to get together with his fellow Commissioner Mrs FischerBoel to assist in reforming the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables in the interests of a healthy and balanced diet Mr President comparing your recent statements on visits to Italy and Ireland confusion has arisen over your position on the Constitutional Treaty P Addressing the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate on 9 November 2006 you stated that there appear to be four possible scenarios for the Constitutional Treaty retaining the text with an addition here or there salvaging the main elements and drafting a shorter Treaty reopening negotiations on certain points or abandoning the Treaty and waiting for a better time to renegotiate it P You also stated categorically that there is no doubt that the text will not be implemented as it stands Yet at Dublin Castle on 30 November you urged Ireland to ratify the current text of the Constitutional Treaty Surely this will be a pointless exercise if as you said in Italy there is no chance of the current text being implemented P Mr President you leave yourself open at best to the accusation of sending out mixed messages or of tailoring your message to suit the audience you are addressing As Members of the European Parliament we have the right to be informed of the clear position of our President on this most important of issues As a representative of a small Member State I feel particularly strongly that all Member States should be involved in the reflection process I do not want to see a situation where the larger Member States such as Italy are consulted and decide on the future of the Constitution and indeed Europe while the smaller Member States are simply told to ratify the text as presented to them I would love to hear your views on this Mr President Thank you very much I believe that it was made very clear during an interesting debate that took place in Ireland which you were unable to attend for very important reasons I am sure I am talking about the European Forum on Ireland at which I had the opportunity to reply to questions similar to yours P I believe that it was made very clear and that all of the Members in attendance understood but we all know that it is very difficult to get people who do not want to understand to understand I said to the European Council on several occasions on behalf of the European Parliament that every country should try to ratify the Treaty That is the European Parliaments position to call upon all of the governments to try to ratify the Treaty P As far as I know that is also your groups position as its leader has often explained That and only that is what I have said that every country must try to ratify the Treaty Are you still in any doubt Mrs Doyle PT As the Commission is aware the air transport service on the Atlantic islands of Madeira and Porto Santo is a public service with the Portuguese Government subsidising the company that exclusively runs the service P Recently however ticket prices for flights between these islands and the Portuguese mainland rose dramatically on account of the increase in the price of oil This decision by the Portuguese Government is in our view a questionable one as it runs counter to the spirit of the Council regulation governing this form of public service obligation which is why I have brought the matter to Parliaments attention How come passengers on these flights are being made to pay for the increase in the price of fuel thereby hampering their mobility especially now that the price of oil is falling and the euro is becoming stronger What is more the Portuguese Government and the Community bodies know that passengers on Madeira and Porto Santo have no alternative sea link with the mainland P This is ample reason for Parliament and the Commission to look into and monitor this measure which penalises the citizens of one of the EUs outermost regions We should like this matter to be clarified and the situation changed which is why we have brought it to the Commissioners attention Mr President I seek your assistance On 17 October I tabled a priority written question to the Commission on the subject of animal testing under REACH I did not ask the question for the good of my health I asked it so that we could have information before the vote this coming week about the number of animals likely to die as a result of the REACH testing process P I should have had a reply I believe by 18 November I am told that it is held up somehow in the Commissions services which some might regard as convenient for the Commission and an exercise in news management These figures are likely to be distressing to those concerned about the testing of animals I would seek your assistance in obtaining a response to that question before Wednesdays vote EL Mr President ladies and gentlemen on 2 May 2006 Canadas annual budget was introduced to Parliament which recommends 100 tax reduction on all Canadian produced wines and beers This budget is under discussion However such a budget will create unfair competition to European Union wines and beers This goes against WTO principles Exports to Canada are of particular importance to the European Union In particular in 2005 the European Union exported wines worth EUR 446 million and beers worth EUR 110 million P The Commission must assume an active role and take the necessary actions to force the Canadian Government to implement its commitments to the WTO P We have always adhered to the commitments we have made to the World Trade Organisation The other nations should do the same ES Mr President on 2 July more than five months ago now the presidential elections were held in Mexico As you all know the winner was Felipe Calderón the current Mexican President P Since those elections the opposition candidate of the Left López Obrador has failed to acknowledge or accept his defeat and worse still the Left has tried to sabotage President Calderóns inauguration and is still threatening the legitimate government and instigating disturbances demonstrations and sabotage against it I therefore wish to condemn this antidemocratic attitude on the part of the Left led by Mr López Obrador and I also wish to condemn the Mexican Lefts unprecedented and unjustifiable boycott P The European institutions cannot look the other way and this European Parliament in particular must support President Calderóns legitimate government in Mexico We in this Parliament must take initiatives to ensure that democracy is respected in Mexico and that the Left acknowledge its defeat and form a democratic and constructive opposition rather than an antidemocratic opposition SK I welcomed the report in which the US President George Bush announced that he would seek to relax visa requirements for the new EU Member States of Central Europe President Bushs decision to launch this programme is among other things a result of longterm pressure exerted by the new Member States Their leaders took every opportunity to remind President Bush of the fact that they would like to see the visa requirements simplified or cancelled altogether thus enabling their citizens to travel to the USA under the visa waiver programme just like the nationals of western European countries P Regarding Slovakia it should be pointed out that as a result of reforms conducted by the government of Mikuláš Dzurinda the country has made substantial economic progress There are no longer such pressing economic reasons for Slovaks to violate their visa status and immigrate illegally to the USA The facilitation of travel and the cancellation of visa requirements for citizens of the new Member States will have to be accompanied by among other things compliance with new stricter security requirements I believe that President Bush will manage to persuade Congress to accept this programme PL Mr President much has been said in this Chamber about achieving the Lisbon objectives and enabling the European Union to compete with the largest economies in the world such as those of the United States China or India Our discussions have still not had any practical impact however and our dreams of high economic growth may never come true as there may be nobody around to help achieve the desired growth P According to a recent UN report by 2050 there will be one hundred million fewer European citizens than there are today Few children are being born European society is ageing and an eversmaller number of workers is supporting an everincreasing number of pensioners P The Lisbon objectives must go hand in hand with an appropriate demographic policy for the Union Such a policy could perhaps be modelled on the measures taken by Finland France and Latvia These countries are currently experiencing a baby boom due to the provision of appropriate incentives and facilities for parents who wish to have children but also wish to be able to support them and who have been enabled to combine their parental responsibilities with paid employment P Europe must look to the quality and quantity of its workforce if it is to achieve economic growth It is therefore vital to develop a Community policy for the development of European society encompassing both the demographic aspect and the immigration of qualified workers from outside the Union EL Mr President ladies and gentlemen there is a lot of talk lately on whether Brussels or Strasbourg should be the seat of the European Parliament and the European Union Both of these are wrong The seat of Europe should be in the city where decisions are taken and lately the decisions regarding the European Unions future are being taken in Ankara This is the truth When great countries such as England were joining Europe the terms were set by Europe Nowadays Turkey is the one setting the terms to Europe in order for Turkey to join This is unacceptable Turkey does not recognise the 25th state wants one port then two ports and all of us are just watching passively When shall we finally understand that this policy supports Ankaras arrogance Can we not understand that this is a rotten apple even before it joins Just imagine how things will be when tomorrow morning Erdogans Turkey joins Europe with our vote Then Turkey will just push us aside from day one PL Mr President the Seventh Congress of the Party of European Socialists was held in Porto from 79 December under the slogan A New Social Europe Many key issues for the future of Europe and the European Union were raised during the congress It was recognised that the provision of appropriate and accessible child care was a priority matter so as to allow young parents to continue in paid employment Investing in our childrens future is an investment in our own future P A great many documents were adopted Chief amongst them were a resolution laying down ten principles for a New Social Europe a resolution on the Middle East a resolution on Belarus and a resolution on a new social democratic energy policy The latter seems to me to be entirely relevant and particularly important because of Europes increasing dependence on a small number of suppliers of sources of energy P Mr President this congress proved once again that the Socialists are the most important political force in Europe It is they who are the driving force working to secure Europes future PL Mr President 25 years ago on the night of 12 December martial law was imposed in Poland Tanks rolled onto the streets the nation was deprived of its freedom and innocent Poles were beaten and killed P All this was done by people in authority who were convinced that they knew better than the nation itself what the nation needed They believed that maintaining an alliance with a foreign regime or rather remaining subservient to it took precedence over the will of the people Essentially what they were concerned about was hanging on to power and all the benefits deriving from it These evil individuals were supported by foreigners pursuing their own imperialist ambitions at the expense of an enslaved nation P I trust the anniversary of this event will be an occasion for Europe to examine its conscience Do we really believe that there are no selfstyled sages amongst us who think they know what other nations need better than those nations themselves Is it not the case that leaders still reach agreements detrimental to the good of their countries and that the desire for leadership and its associated benefits often takes priority over the good of the nations politicians are meant to serve P The life freedom and dignity of every individual must be sacrosanct for us DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen as a European citizen and a European politician there are two things that bother me The first is the fact of structural deficiencies in the European Unions energy policy of the consequences of which we were once more reminded as recently as the beginning of November P Secondly there is the quality of Europes relations with Russia It is quite obviously negligent to deny our current dependence on energy providers that are not merely foreign but owned by foreign states The sad fact is that the next thing to happen is that economic and political interests merge and start to influence what happens on the political level playing field P We make the claim to adhere in all our dealings to the principle that European values must never take second place to economic interests and that principle is a core element in our Community In our dealings with Russia the expectation of our dialogues on energy being fruitful must not be contingent on our keeping silent about our misgivings concerning the violations of human rights and of freedom of the press What must be quite clear to us is that either there will be a Europe founded upon values or there will soon be no Europe left PL Mr President this is a British Airways frequent flyer card I tried to do something with it when recently 100 Members of the British House of Commons protested in connection with the discriminatory treatment meted out to a British Airways employee wearing a small cross P In my view action of this kind is unacceptable in Europe which is founded on a Christian heritage dating back centuries I would therefore like to express my solidarity with all our British fellow Members and with all the British politicians and journalists protesting against this situation Mr President Ftype isolation prisons for political detainees were introduced in Turkey at the end of 2000 with the aim of psychologically breaking and subsequently reeducating the prisoners In the last 6 years 28 people have been killed 122 have died on hunger strike and there have been thousands of protests from within as well outside Turkey P Mr Behiç Aşçı an Istanbul lawyer representing Ftype prisoners has been on hunger strike for 251 days Mr President you yourself much to your credit took some protest actions a few weeks ago but the Turkish authorities have been stubbornly deaf Mr Aşçı is now very near to death I plead with you to communicate directly and urgently with the Turkish Prime Minister and request that he deal with the case of Mr Aşçı personally in a last effort to save the life of a Europeanminded Turkish idealist Mr President this summer the Russian State Duma introduced two laws allowing action to be taken against Russian and nonRussian citizens abroad Authorised by a decision of the President of the Russian Federation euphemistically named special assignment units of the federal security services may be used against socalled terrorists or those who have allegedly libelled the state Those laws are a licence to kill and the first public execution of a British citizen was carried out last month when Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned and died in London However the murder was bungled and a radioactive evidence trail stretches from London to Moscow P Tony Blairs reaction was to say that nothing must come between Britains relations with Russia The Russians reaction was to say that no suspect whatever the evidence will be extradited to Britain But the reaction of the world must be to exclude Russia from the civilised community of nations until its international murder squads are no longer operational EL Mr President today is the only day suitable for my speech Today 11 December marks 60 years from the foundation of Unicef and we are celebrating the International Childrens Day The Declaration of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of the Child have been signed even though some states have not yet signed and the Commission has already presented its Strategy on the Rights of the Child on a European level P Therefore we hope for coordinated action throughout the European Unions external and internal policies and an effort from every Member State for the protection of the rights of the child which from what we see is not only threatened by poverty illiteracy and armed conflicts in countries outside the Union but is equally in danger within our own civilised countries from malicious attacks by people who do not have collective responsibility FR Mr President on 22 June 2006 the Commission presented a communication in response to the crisis of overproduction in the European winegrowing sector recommending the grubbingup of 400 000 hectares of vines in the next five years that is almost 12 of the European Unions 34 million hectares P I want to draw your attention today to the existence of illegal vine plantations in Europe which are thought to cover an area of 150 000 hectares in the European Union as a whole According to the Commissions own figures in a March 2004 report these illegal vine plantations are equivalent to an output of 5 to 8 million hectolitres at a time when European overproduction is put at 12 million hectolitres The permanent grubbingup of these illegal vines would allow a measure of balance to be restored P Before any decision on grubbingup is taken I therefore call on the Commission to determine the precise scale of these illegal plantations LT Mr President ladies and gentlemen the most important item on the European Union agenda is still energy security and the common energy policy However the formulation and implementation of such a policy is a longterm project P Germany and Russia have entered into a bilateral agreement to lay a gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea a pipeline that is anything but safe from an ecological viewpoint bearing in mind the debris from World War II on the sea bed which threatens the Baltic States with dreadful consequences In the meantime the EU is demanding that safe modernised atomic energy reactors be closed P Scientists estimate that by the year 2010 there will be a shortage of 35 billion kilowatts of electrical energy in the Baltic region Where will we get it how much will we pay for it and will we feel safe Has anyone calculated to what extent the shortage of electrical energy will affect EU competitiveness P I invite all Member States after considering the changes in the energy market to support Lithuanias application of Article 37 of the Treaty of Accession to the EU in considering the possibility of extending the operational life of the Ignalina Atomic Energy Plant Mr President I hope you had time to enjoy some hill walking while you were in Ireland P One of the issues you may not have been aware of during your visit is the deep unease in the countryside about how the Commission is applying onfarm inspections in relation to the common agricultural policy and crosscompliance There is a huge gap between what the Commission says it is doing in relation to simplification initiatives and what is happening on the ground in relation to crosscompliance inspections P The checklist with which farmers are required to comply is very long and confusing Allied to that there is real fear that if you breach one of these regulations you will face a penalty on your payment Consumers deserve to know that farmers meet high standards of food safety and production but I would ask whether these unannounced spotchecks of the detailed sort I have outlined are the way to meet that objective The Irish Government itself is to blame for the long delay in implementing the Nitrates Directive with the result that we are now forced to have all the onfarm inspections catapulted into the latter end of 2006 P Could I ask the Commission to specify exactly what it wants from farmers and to ensure that all Member States are complying with the rules LT I would like to draw your attention to the work of our fine translators to the quality of their work Lately one hears many discontented voices saying that the quality of translations is declining You are no doubt aware Mr President that we allot large sums of money for translations and we rightly take pride in the possibility of speaking various languages in European institutions I think that one of the problems causing an increase in the amount of complaints about the quality of translations is the fact that in our Parliament the translation quality control system is not appropriately set up and does not function adequately Indeed the quality of translations is usually checked by colleagues that is they check each others work which is probably not very objective Queries from Members of Parliament are not often responded to by Translation Service staff At least I have never received any replies I hope that the Parliamentary Bureau will bring this to their attention PL Mr President we should remain constantly alert to the situation beyond Europes Eastern border that is to say in Russia and Ukraine We have focused a great deal of attention on negotiations with Russia recently but I urge the House not to neglect events in Ukraine P I would like the House to send out a clear message that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and support its progress towards democracy In other words we do not wish antidemocratic processes to develop and gather strength Ukraine is a large neighbour of ours and we have an interest in it It must not be sidelined P Accordingly I believe that every message sent out by this House or by members of other institutions to the Government of Ukraine and in particular to Ukrainian society is extremely important PL Mr President next year we shall celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome I believe that this will provide an ideal opportunity for considered reflection and debate on the future of the European Union As we recall the fundamental principles underpinning the concept of integration we should be able to find the answer to key questions such as where Europe is headed and what the possibilities for future enlargement are Our policy towards the Balkan states Ukraine Turkey and also Georgia and Moldova needs to be clearly defined The Union should cooperate more closely with these countries and provide stronger support for the changes taking place within them P The most important issue we have to deal with at present is internal reform of the Union which involves strengthening the role of the European Parliament and improving the decisionmaking system During the next six months under German Presidency we should also work on a solution to the future of the Constitutional Treaty and the issue of energy security Well that is the last word and it is also the last time that I will have the honour of presiding over the oneminute speeches That is why we have been more generous with speaking time and I would ask the Commission and the Council for their understanding I thank you for your patience but during the final moments of the party there is a free bar and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to those people who have wished to speak on previous occasions but have not been able to P That

    "input": "Community Customs Code Customs 2013 programme debate The next item is the joint debate on the reports P by Mrs Fourtou on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Community Customs Code Modernized Customs Code C604192005 and P by Mrs Fourtou on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an action programme for customs in the Community Customs 2013 C601582006 Member of the Commission Mr President first of all I would like to thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as well as the other committees involved and in particular Mrs Fourtou as rapporteur for the reports to be discussed tonight P The modernisation of the European customs environment is an essential contribution to attaining the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy It is a must if we want the European Union to remain an attractive place to do business and maintain the external competitiveness of EU companies In this context it is crucial to deepen the single market by making the EU a fullyintegrated customs territory P This reform is also critical if we want to live up to the challenges of globalisation and reinforce the role of customs in protecting our citizens and companies from security and safety hazards such as counterfeiting dangerous goods or the devices of international terrorism P The modernised Community Customs Code will provide the legal framework for the development of a simple and paperless environment for customs and trade based on the best use of information and communication technology P The present Community Customs Code was adapted in 1992 Since then it has undergone only limited changes This means that the Code has not kept pace with the radical changes to the environment in which customs and traders operate particularly in respect of the rapid and irreversible adoption of electronic data exchange The Customs Code has to be adapted to fit the electronic environment In addition it is commonly held by customs authorities and traders alike that current customs procedure and processes are unnecessarily complicated They also do not reflect the changing focus of customs work moving from the collection of declining customs duties towards the application of nontariff measures This includes in particular security and safety measures the fight against counterfeiting money laundering and drugs and the application of sanitary health and consumer protection measures P With your support the proposal for a modernised Customs Code on the table tonight together with the proposals on the Council table and ecustoms will make customs work better faster and more cheaply P Let me once again and now more specifically turn to Mrs Fourtou and the Committee on the Internal Market for their detailed and most valuable assessment of the Commissions proposal for a modernised Customs Code I know there is unanimous support in the Committee on the Internal Market for the rapporteurs recommendations Progress in the Council is complementing your work I am pleased to report that on 4 December the Competitiveness Council showed a keen interest in the key elements of the reform Ministers gave strong support to the Commissions proposals on the single window on centralised clearance and on customs agents while inviting the Commission to pursue the work to implement these in an acceptable manner for all Member States P I would like to thank Parliament for its constructive contribution to the debate on these three issues but I must also inform you that in at least one of them the Commissions position remains unchanged Thus it is the Commissions firm opinion that the accreditation of professional customs agents is not a matter for the Customs Code There is a future for the profession in an open competitive market through selfregulation and the recognition provided by the status of authorised economic operator P Though there is no debate on the ecustoms proposal tonight I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur Mr HeatonHarris and the Committee on the Internal Market for its full support for an extremely ambitious Commission proposal It is indeed challenging to propose that all Member States and the Commission commit themselves to developing common electronic systems for customs proposals by an agreed date Let me stress that the firm support from Parliament is more than welcome in order to convince Member States that despite budgetary constraints they need to develop their customs IT system in a Community framework I am confident that the Council will acknowledge this step and the proposal can soon be adopted P I very much appreciate the efforts of the European Parliament and particularly those of Mrs Fourtou to come to an agreement in a single reading on the Customs 2013 proposal This will definitely ensure the continuity of the programme activities as of 1 January 2008 The speedy adoption of Customs 2013 shows that there is a broad agreement across all the institutions on the obvious need to guarantee the effective functioning of the internal market in the customs field Indeed the customs environment is undergoing major changes The Customs 2013 programme will be an essential instrument to ensure efficient cooperation and coordination between all customs administrations It will facilitate the introduction of new transEuropean computerised systems reinforce networks between customs officials and promote and establish common training modules P Once the two customs proposals under debate and the ecustoms proposal are finally adopted by both Parliament and the Council they will enable the customs services of the EU to meet the major challenges They will facilitate international trade foster simpler control and will more effectively protect the internal market and the health safety and security of our citizens through more efficient control rapporteur FR Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen modernised Customs Code paperless Customs Customs 2013 programme these three reports that we are discussing in this session demonstrate the growing importance of customs and their role in the European Unions desire for competitiveness and efficiency P These three reports are closely linked but in the interests of greater clarity I shall first present the modernised Customs Code and then move on to the Customs 2013 programme P The Customs Code as you said Mr Kovacs dates from 1992 It was legitimate to modernise it in order to adapt it to the evolving range of tasks undertaken by Customs and the radical changes that have taken place in international trade It is a matter of rationalising customs procedures by laying the foundations of customs clearance systems that are accessible and interoperable within the European Union That is why this proposal is accompanied by a proposal for a decision on electronic customs for which Mr HeatonHarris is the rapporteur P The new Code includes 200 articles and we have concentrated on the principal points or at least the most controversial points that is the customs representative the authorised economic operator centralised customs clearance and comitology P Article 11 is concerned with the customs representative Until now national legislation has made it possible to reserve the right of representation to a professional category In the context of the Single Market and the electronic environment however there is no longer any grounds for this monopoly Furthermore some businesses are able to have an integrated service that takes care of customs formalities The right to customs representation therefore must be open to all Nonetheless in many Member States using a customs agent is traditional and remains very useful for small businesses That is why without wishing to retain a monopoly the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection adopted an amendment that among the criteria for the status of customs representative provides for recognition of the existence of practical standards of competence or professional qualifications in order to satisfy those Member States for whom the abolition of this monopoly is difficult to accept P We have not yet found the ideal solution and this question will certainly be raised again at second reading because certain delegations within the Council are still expressing reservations and going so far as to demand regulated access to the profession P The authorised economic operator was introduced into the Customs Code by means of Regulation 648 of 13 April 2005 known as the security regulation This statute is not yet properly in existence because the provisions for its implementation have just been adopted by the Commission The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has introduced a clarification making a clear distinction between the customs simplification Authorised Economic Operator and the security and safety Authorised Economic Operator P Centralised customs clearance is a facilitation that in principle has been well received but the Member States are wondering about the collection of customs duties The Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has adopted a fairly radical position in demanding that electronic customs clearance operations should be free of charge and that customsoffices should be open 24 hours a day Indeed in the interests of fair competition between national customs authorities the rule must apply to all It is necessary however to ensure that there is harmonisation of the checking processes P Finally the provisions in the proposal make constant reference to comitology This procedure is necessary because reference needs to be made to experts to establish the provisions for implementation of the Code In accordance with the new interinstitutional agreement of July 2006 certain provisions of the Code are subject to the new procedure for comitology with scrutiny Therefore having sought the opinion of the European Parliaments legal service we have adopted in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection amendments that are aimed at adapting the comitology procedure corresponding to the different articles The Committee on International Trade adopted amendments for the codecision procedure for certain provisions that would normally fall within their competence by virtue of the strengthened cooperation procedure We considered however that its position was contrary to that of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and we had to reject those amendments P Those then very briefly are the main points of the report and as I said just now it is very closely linked with the report concerning the Customs 2013 programme Reading the midterm evaluation of the Customs 2007 programme has demonstrated that this programme is well adapted to the needs of administrations and that it plays a crucial role in helping participating countries to share their experiences This evaluation recommended strengthening the activities carried out in the field of training and information exchange The programme has a budget of EUR 3228 million over a period of six years and its aim is to help the customs administrations of the participating countries to encourage legitimate exchanges to simplify and speed up customs procedures and to ensure the safety and security of citizens and the financial interests of the Community P The amendments adopted in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection are in line with the work of the Council and I wish to thank the Finnish Presidency in particular because in order to satisfy the European Parliaments legitimate budgetary demands it has on many occasions negotiated with Member States and defended our position Therefore we shall be able I hope to conclude this matter at first reading P The reports concerning customs are eminently technical and complicated That is why I wish to thank most warmly the various people I have spoken to within the DirectorateGeneral for Taxation and Customs Union who have always responded to my every request and allowed me to tackle these subjects more easily I thank also my fellow Members and the Chairman of our Committee for their help and support At a time when trade is speeding up when organised crime and counterfeiting threaten our security and our market customs and economic operators need our full support draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade FR Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen firstly Commissioner I wish to congratulate you on the important work that you and your services have accomplished in the interests of modernisation of customs legislation which is a necessary condition for the good functioning of our internal market I should like also to warmly congratulate Mrs Fourtou who made some very useful proposals for improvement P With regard to international trade I shall make three comments concerning questions of competence between committees comitology and lastly the parliamentary dimension in international trade I think Mr President that there must be an end to rivalry over competence between the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on International Trade or at the very least these rivalries must not delay the adoption of European legislation that our internal market so desperately needs It is not sensible to deny the link between international trade and the issue of Community customs At a time when Europe is being closely watched I regret that Rule 47 of our Rules of Procedure has been violated in respect of strengthened cooperation between committees because the amendments voted for unanimously by the Committee on International Trade have been brushed aside in an irregular manner and will not alas be put to the vote in plenary P I am delighted however that our amendments have brought to light an abusive use of comitology procedures by the European Commission I hope that in the end it will be forced to use the new comitology procedure with scrutiny which came out of the interinstitutional agreement of July 2006 On that subject it will be important to clarify the use of Article 194c and the European Commission will have to assure us that it does not intend to modify the Community Customs Code according to an international trade agreement concluded by it under Article 133 of the Treaty on European Union P Ladies and gentlemen at a time when the failure of the Doha agenda harms the rules of international trade we must protect our producers and our consumers from security and safety problems thanks to border controls In this context never has the parliamentary dimension of international trade been so important particularly in relation to the functioning of Community customs on behalf of the PPEDE Group DE Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members who have cooperated on this difficult dossier above all Mrs Fourtou who has fought her way through this complex set of rules with great success P The rapporteur for our group Mr HeatonHarris unfortunately cannot be here today and so as the coordinator with competence for this dossier I shall be speaking on his behalf and that of the group today if I may P The Community Customs Code is an extremely important project which will remove persisting hurdles in the European internal market and particularly with regard to piracy and intellectual property has global significance For example it enables centralised clearance at an enterprises headquarters which is important to the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection in particular I think that this report on the Modernised Customs Code helps to simplify existing customs procedures and will also help to improve the competitiveness of European enterprises P I should like to focus on just a few points From the outset one critical point was Article 14 on authorised economic operators about which Mrs Fourtou has spoken I think that the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection has reached a good compromise on this one which gives these persons greater freedom in the performance of their activities The Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats will therefore withdraw its Amendment 57 and support the compromise reached in the Committee on Internal Market P This compromise makes clear that we want our enterprises to enjoy greater freedom and we should also communicate to the outside world that the regulations of the Modernised Customs Code have been drawn up for our enterprises and in their favour The Community Customs Code will not be an obstacle to greater competitiveness P Finally I should like to highlight and champion the amendment to Article 125 that was tabled by Mr HeatonHarris on behalf of our group This article enables Member States to introduce simplifications beyond the scope of the Customs Code within the framework of bilateral or multinational agreements The old Customs Code already included the possibility of closer cooperation and so this possibility is already being used in practice P It would be detrimental to our enterprises if we were to now abolish this framework and I believe that that also accords well with the thoughts of Mr Audy on behalf of the PSE Group ES Mr President I have the feeling that with regard to this issue disputes amongst MEPs as such have been kept to a minimum particularly with the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats having withdrawn its Amendment 57 I believe that Mrs Fourtou and the Commissions services in the TAXUD DirectorateGeneral have done a wonderful job and have explained an issue that appeared to be complex in a very clear fashion but we still have a few amendments that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is insisting on presenting P I believe that the first group of amendments raises no difficulties since it involves adapting the comitology proposals to the new comitology agreement between Parliament and the other institutions With regard to the other amendments there are still certain issues outstanding such as the issue of representatives at customs A significant proportion of Members of this House at least believe that customs activities require a degree of professional dedication and cannot be replaced with an abstract freedom to carry out customs activities There are too many considerations of a personnel nature including security considerations which make this a legitimate profession that must be maintained and must not be eliminated on the basis of a liberalisation theory that has nothing to do with reality P The amendments presented by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the economic operators authorised and also particularly for consumers and citizens on free electronic customs processing and the twentyfour hour provision of these services also seem to me to be positive I believe that it would be a good thing to simplify customs procedures which are usually very complex and which hinder the internal market P I like the Socialist Group in the European Parliament in general am therefore in favour of the amendments presented by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection I believe that Mr Audy is absolutely right to raise the issue of comitology but I believe that in accordance with the reports that we have received from the legal services the only possible solution is the one adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and that the problem is not one of confrontation amongst committees but rather one of our all having to adjust to this situation in view of the current reality I do not therefore believe that there is any kind of problem between the two committees P In short Mr President we are in agreement with Mrs Fourtous report I believe that we could reach an agreement very quickly amongst the three institutions in order to approve the two reports and we hope that this Parliament will approve the amendments from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs without any great difficulty on behalf of the ALDE Group SV Mr President I should firstly like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur Mrs Fourtou for the splendid job she has done In general there is no rule without its exceptions and that is a good thing Our European Union does not consist only of Member States that should be covered in full by the Communitys customs regulations The EU also consists of territories that for historical and other reasons have in different ways been forced to place themselves outside the Communitys harmonisation of indirect taxation Such territories include the Åland Islands which belong to Finland the Channel Islands the Canaries Agios Oros in Greece and the overseas French departments P It is important for both the European Union and its territories that trade between them be able to take place as smoothly as possible Because these territories are very different even from each other in terms of their trade with the European Union it is important that it be made possible to introduce special exemptions for them This would benefit the European Union and our efforts to achieve the objectives in terms of the Lisbon Agenda P Special arrangements for these areas would not disrupt trade within the Community and we should of course all benefit from the smooth flow of trade and from the fact that unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles had not been erected I am therefore pleased that in its report the committee has taken note of this need and adopted a pragmatic approach My hope now is that the Council and the Commission too will meet Parliament half way on these points Bilateral arrangements too must be possible in certain cases It is important for the EU to respond to the populations special needs and not to get hung up on standard solutions that are appropriate for many but not for everyone I am pleased that the reform of the Customs Code can also help strengthen peoples confidence in the EU which has of course seriously wavered recently on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President the European Parliament and Council Regulation laying down the Community Customs Code is a document amounting to a thorough modernisation of the Customs Code in force since 1992 This modernisation is required in view of the radical changes that have taken place in the area of international trade Accordingly the regulation aims to simplify customs legislation and procedure It is designed to benefit commercial entities and customs administrations to reduce the cost of customs formalities and to respond to commercial challenges involving safety and protection detecting counterfeiting and money laundering and also protecting health and the environment P The new Community Customs Code goes beyond simplifying certain procedures Fundamental changes in Customs legislation have been undertaken in a number of areas This document is inextricably linked to the report on computerisation of Customs procedures The decision taken by Parliament and the Council concerning an electronic environment for customs authorities and traders provides for the creation and application of safe interoperable and accessible electronic customs systems which should simplify and improve flow along the supply chain and also customs procedures P The third proposal establishing an action programme for duties in the Community Customs2013 intensifies cooperation between customs administrations and their officials TransEuropean information networks are provided for to facilitate the completion of customs formalities in the internal market and allowing products to be taxed according to national and Community tax legislation within the market This programme plays a key role in the harmonious operation of the internal market and the management of the Unions external borders It also contributes to attaining the Commissions objectives for the years 20052009 and the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy FR Mr President a codification is a moment of intelligence one moves away from law to which one is subjected to law that has been thought out I am therefore very pleased about the reports on customs codification by our fellow Members and friends Mrs Fourtou and Mr Audy particularly because since 1919 in the case of Germany 193435 for France 1938 for Mexico and so on we had lost our codifying ambition Here of course let us not be naïve we are codifying the customs rules simply because of pressure from the United States after 11 September who want customs that are no longer to do with budgets but with security hence the addition of control by authorised economic operator by customs representatives and so on P Beyond this little codification however we shall have to think of a customs codification that is legally equal to the challenges of globalisation Since maritime law was codified at Montego Bay in the 1970s and since International Trade Law was codified at Marrakesh in the 1990s the 21st century will have to devise a customs codification at the only level appropriate to international trade that is at global level P The place for working towards this model of a global code exists it is the World Customs Organisation in Brussels in partnership with the World Trade Organisation in Geneva The sources of inspiration for this model code exist too it is the Tokyo Convention and the Brussels Convention on customs value and rules of origin There remains the purpose of this model for a customs code that is a revolution in customs technology so that we can move out of the current archaic system and have customs duties that can be adjusted reimbursed subsidised and negotiated P Adjusted according to the production cost differential between one country and another reimbursed in the form of a customs credit offered by the importing country to the exporting country subsidised in favour of exporting countries of the South who would receive a customs credit supplement negotiated finally in the stock exchange like the protectionist pollution quotas In this way we shall at last achieve a reconciliation between international free trade which is necessary and national social protection which is equally necessary This is the marriage of David Ricardo the free trader and Friedrich List the protectionist SK To begin with I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mrs Fourtou and Mr HeatonHarris for their work in drafting these technically demanding reports P From the very beginning the Customs Union has been considered a cornerstone of the European Community The Customs Code is a practical instrument that ensures smooth transborder trade and it should therefore take into consideration the new challenges of a globalising economy The creation and subsequent implementation of a modernised Customs Code is a logical and essential prerequisite for the effective development of the European market P The proposal reflects efforts to create a customs and trade environment based on improved effectiveness of customs clearance procedures through information exchange elimination of the administrative burden and facilitation of trade at European and international levels In this age of technology an electronic system offers new opportunities for the quicker and more effective implementation of commonly recognised standards The proposal offers a unique opportunity to overcome existing discrepancies between the customs systems of Member States as it will ensure enhanced interoperability of national systems which we have so far failed to encourage adequately P At present securityrelated issues are becoming a priority and the proposal therefore also focuses on this area It includes specific measures to secure external borders as well as data protection Ladies and gentlemen I believe that these proposals will be accepted during the vote If they are not we would paradoxically be blocking the free trade that we are actually striving to facilitate PT Mr President to whom I extend my warmest greetings Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I naturally welcome this initiative and commend the rapporteurs on the quality of their work This initiative is of the highest importance given that the code currently in force dates back to 1992 It must be modernised to reflect the changes that have since taken place and must address those changes P There are two aspects that strike me as crucial Firstly this new code will help boost international trade because simplifying the processes may lead to an increase in the competitiveness of European businesses and thus to stronger economic growth To this end opening up to new technologies as well as placing greater value on those technologies and even enforcing their use represents a highly significant step that should help strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy P That being said there is a second point that must be highlighted which relates to the nature of the current functions of customs Security needs to be increased at various levels to protect public health to ensure food safety and to combat crimes such as money laundering counterfeiting and fraud more effectively In other words consumers must be better protected P I should like to conclude by saying that this proposal is a positive step towards safeguarding more effectively the interests of Europeans both as manufacturers and as consumers As such we naturally endorse the proposal Mr President I wish to thank the rapporteur for her work on this issue I wish however to talk about one specific issue regarding customs policies The single biggest problem currently facing the EU in relation to its customs policies is the unwillingness of the Turkish Government to implement the Ankara Protocol Turkey promised the European Union 18 months ago that it would do so and that accordingly Turkish ports and airports would be open to Cypriot ships and air traffic Turkey has failed to honour this political commitment which is a central element of the Turkish accession negotiations to join the European Union P Last week Turkey offered to open one port to Cypriot traffic This offer was not even given in writing to the Finnish Presidency and even so it falls well short of the commitment given by the Turkish Government that it would implement the Protocol It is now very likely that up to eight chapters of Turkeys accession negotiations with the European Union will be suspended some time this week which is the recommendation of the European Commission P On a broader level Turkey faces the real possibility that EU accession talks may be fully suspended in time if it does not implement the Ankara Protocol and open up Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot traffic EL Mr President I consider the speech of the previous speaker quite useful and definitely well timed and I would like to endorse everything he said However I will not just stop at what he said I would like to refer to the main subject of todays discussion by saying that technology the Lisbon Strategy and the logic behind the common market force us to modernise the Customs Code P The delicate position of the customs representatives and their particular professional nature necessitates the specification of certain criteria for the proper performance of their activities without these criteria having a negative effect on the internal market or the free transportation of services This is the equation we have to solve Therefore we have amended Article 11 of the new Customs Code so that there is no numerical limitation in this particular profession the recognition of customs representatives throughout the European Union Member States is established and of course there is free competition in the sector in general P On the other hand several of my colleagues including me have insisted that the criterion of practical standards or professional qualifications for individuals who wish to become customs representatives must be precisely specified This is because the usefulness of the profession will be acknowledged as well as the considerable services they offer to companies as well as to the customs authorities and primarily it will ensure the safety and protection of the publics interests P Therefore I believe that with the proposal submitted today by the European Parliament we achieve a proper balance in that context I would like to thank Mrs Fourtou for her efforts to arrive at this useful compromise within the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection EL Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is clear that if we wish to create a common market according to the provisions of the Lisbon Strategy and become a considerable competitive power on a global scale we have no other choice but to effectively meet these trade challenges and adapt to the rapid technological developments To this purpose not only do we have to eliminate bureaucratic customs procedures but also amend the laws that govern them in depth P Even though our goal is to simplify commercial transactions between Member States while at the same time safeguarding security and protection of European citizens such a goal would not be feasible without the presence of customs representatives namely specialised professionals with certified knowledge Therefore I consider it necessary to issue accreditation to the right individuals using the most commonly accepted criteria P I consider that customs brokers provide the necessary guarantee of knowledge and experience for the execution of customs operations and therefore they must be considered accredited customs representatives Let us not forget that they exist as a profession in the vast majority of Member States and they serve an important role to the benefit of all financial agents and especially for small to mediumsized enterprises whose activities are of vital importance to European growth P To conclude I should like to stress that modernising the Customs Code cannot in any way be identified as deregulation of the labour market of serious professionals who historically have proven their effectiveness PL Mr President the European Unions customs system should serve two main purposes Firstly it should protect the Communitys economic and financial interests and secondly it should facilitate legal trade exchanges and the acceleration and simplification of customs formalities P Unfortunately despite the existence of the Customs 2007 Programme and the allocation of almost EUR 150 million these aims have not been fully achieved One only has to consider the negative impact on the Community market of largescale smuggling of alcohol and tobacco products and recently also of liquid fuels Not only does the scale of this organised smuggling destabilise the internal market but the Unions budget also suffers as it is deprived of the hundreds of millions of euro it should obtain from customs duties P This state of affairs also has an impact on the trade in foodstuffs Products often appear for sale on this market at prices significantly lower than the cost of production which indicates that the customs system has been evaded This happened recently on the poultry market in Poland and over the last two years there have also been problems with frozen strawberries from China P The second purpose of the customs system namely facilitating trade exchanges is not being fulfilled This is particularly obvious along the European Unions eastern border with Russia Belarus and Ukraine Tiresome procedures corruption and queues of vehicles stretching back for miles all contribute to making it unattractive to export goods from the European Union P I very much hope that the EUR 323 million allocated for the implementation of the Customs 2013 programme will allow significant improvements to be made Member of the Commission Mr President I wish to begin by thanking the honourable Members for their valuable contributions to the debate and for the positive attitude towards the Commissions proposals P The Commission has given appropriate consideration to Parliaments 58 amendments to the Modernised Customs Code and has found the majority as many as 32 acceptable 9 acceptable in principle or in part and only 17 unacceptable P I would point out that those amendments which the Commission finds unacceptable are related to the key issues that I highlighted earlier and that are commonly debated by both Parliament and the Council P I must reiterate that as regards customs representation Amendments 14 19 and 57 the Commission maintains that the accreditation of professional customs agents falls outside the scope of the Customs Code The Commission fully recognises the role played by customs agents in the world of trade These agents like any other economic operator should have the right to exercise their profession in another Member State and professional competence in one Member State should be recognised in another This is a basic feature of the single market and essential in an electronic environment P The Commission is actively working with the professional associations like CLECAT and CONFIAD listening to their concerns and trying to find a satisfactory solution The proposed change offers substantial benefits to business in general such as increased competition between customs service providers and opens new and wider business opportunities for customs representatives beyond national borders P On comitology I believe that our legal services have come to conclusions that are not too dissimilar There are indeed a few articles where the Commission considers that the regulatory procedure its scrutiny should not apply but in most cases our institutions respective analyses are converging P I should like to clarify why the Commission cannot support certain amendments The first I should mention is Amendment 21 which suggests that in Article 221 the words administrative and criminal be deleted All Member States impose criminal penalties in customs matters and apply even if they are not always described as administrative penalties measures of an administrative nature intended to penalise noncompliance with the customs rules There is for example the withdrawal or suspension of authorisations in case of serious misuse Such administrative measures play an essential role in the uniform and proportionate application of customs legislation It is therefore necessary that Article 221 continues to refer explicitly to both administrative and criminal treatment of infringements P The Commission cannot agree with Amendments 23 and 25 relating to customs fees The Commissions intentions are simply to limit as far as possible the charging of customs fees in particular such fees should not be charged for the drawingup of electronic declarations On the other hand we find it inappropriate to prevent the collection of fees where attendance of customs staff is requested beyond the normal office hours We hold the view that customs fees are only legitimate where customs render a service that goes beyond their normal mission P I should also mention Amendments 30 40 and 41 which aim at granting benefits to railway companies The Commission cannot accept them because they are going against our efforts to build up a level playing field for all transport operators be they road inland waterways or air transporters In fact the original proposals are likely to have been misunderstood and I am confident that once further explained their rationale and fairness will become obvious P In conclusion I can assure you that these issues can and will be urgently and seriously addressed The Commission is confident that given the spirit of openness and cooperation that has marked the consultations to date both in Parliament and in the Council practical and appropriate solutions will be found so that the Modernised Customs Code can enter into force as planned in 2009 P With regard to the customs 2013 programme proposal I confirm that the Commission fully supports all the amendments proposed by Parliament I hope that the report by Mrs Fourtou will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority P Let me finish by repeating that the strong support by the European Parliament for the ecustoms proposal will certainly be acknowledged by the Council and speed up the adoption of the proposal The debate is closed P The vote will take place tomorrow at 1130 am",

    "input": "Formal sitting Award of the 2006 Sakharov Prize Ladies and gentlemen Mr President of the Commission Commissioners it is a great pleasure for the European Parliament to receive the winner of the 2006 Sakharov Prize Mr Milinkievitch leader of the opposition United Democratic Forces in Belarus P Please believe me Mr Milinkievitch when I say that we are particularly happy to have you here with us today P Applause P There have been times when we thought that you would not be able to come Our Sakharov Prize winners have often been unable to come here to receive the prize Aung San Suu Kyi Wei Jingsheng and the Women in White have regrettably been unable to attend this ceremony P We should remember that we Europeans at home in our consolidated democracies often take human rights for granted seeing them as something natural and indisputable like the air we breathe We enjoy our political and civil freedoms sometimes forgetting what it costs to obtain them and accustomed to exercising them We become accustomed to good things very quickly and even countries that have obtained freedom later enjoy it as if they have always had it and as if everybody had it P We must remember however that billions of people on our planet lack the freedom that we enjoy P Our Union is based on respect for human rights and defending them and promoting them around the world is part of our raison dêtre Not just for moral reasons but also in our own interest In terms of Europes interests it is a priority that our freedom should be exercised by the whole of humanity P The Sakharov Prize is therefore an expression of the European Unions defence of and commitment to human rights and this year it is being awarded to a person who is dedicating his life to the fight for freedom in his country P Everybody knows that the presidential elections in Belarus in March were neither free nor fair and that the European Union was not able to send its observers their access to the country being denied P Mr Milinkievitch has had the courage to challenge the last dictatorship in Europe he has managed to unite the democratic opposition forces in order to restore political rights and freedoms in his country P He has headed mass demonstrations and has been arrested for urging his fellow countrymen to defend their fundamental rights P Mr Milinkievitch you have become a symbol of resistance to oppression and of hope for a democratic future P We share your ambition that Belarusian society should obtain the right to elect its leaders democratically the right to independent information the right to create nongovernmental organisations and the right to an independent and impartial judiciary P That is something that the European Parliament has always defended We have protested against the violence the arbitrary arrests and the politicallymotivated sentences by the Belarusian regime against people fighting for fundamental rights in that country P The Prize that you are receiving today is a demonstration of our support for all of the people fighting alongside you P This is not the first time that we have awarded this prize to people from Belarus In 2004 this Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to the Belarus Association of Journalists to professionals who were risking their lives in order to discover the truth and to make it known P Today two years later we are once again showing our full support for the fight for democracy in Belarus because things have not improved since then P The death penalty is still carried out regularly in that country I wish to condemn the arrest and sentencing of Aleksander Kazulin who is currently on hunger strike in prison and I wish to tell you that we are convinced that Belaruss future lies in sharing in the freedom and prosperity of democratic Europe P You are a scientist Mr Milinkievitch as was Andrei Sakharov himself Both of you have shared the same opinions the same values and the same education and you have experienced the same tragic consequences of confronting a totalitarian regime P Today the prize bearing the name of the scientist Sakharov is being awarded to another scientist but above all it is being awarded to the hope of a democratic Belarus and to all the people fighting alongside you to make it a reality P You have the floor Mr Milinkievitch P Sustained applause P The President awarded the Sakharov Prize leader of the democratic opposition in Belarus FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen I shall speak in my mother tongue because I would like to say what I think and I always think in Belarusian I am therefore going to speak in the language that best allows me to express my feelings P Parliament stood and applauded Mr Milinkievitch P The speaker spoke in his mother tongue the text below being a translation P I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament most warmly for awarding me this high honour the Andrei Sakharov Prize named after the brilliant physicist and ardent defender of human rights I would also like to thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak to you P This prize is not for me alone It is for all the Belarusians for all of those who were in the square in Minsk last March who have been thrown into prison and expelled from universities and workplaces This prize is for all of those who are carrying on with the fight There are many of us We are the ones who want Belarus to return to the family of European democracies and who are ready to sacrifice our personal wellbeing our freedom and even our lives to get there P Belarus has always been a European country It has given a lot to Europe making many sacrifices In the 19th century it gave Europe a prototype for a first democratic constitution the statute of the GrandDuchy of Lithuania It gave the world several eminent personalities such as Guillaume Apollinaire Marc Chagall Fyodor Dostoevsky Dimitri Shostakovich and Tadeusz Kościuszko The Belarusians were the second in Europe to translate the Bible into their mother tongue During the Second World War it was in Belarus that the most powerful resistance movement in Europe emerged costing the lives of one out of every three inhabitants Of the six million Jews exterminated in the Holocaust one million came from Belarus P If anyone deserves freedom it is us We have earned it through the whole of our history and the sacrifices we have made on its behalf Every century as a result of endless wars Belarus lost from a quarter to a third of its sons and daughters It lost its elite Our people have suffered the forced uprooting of their national identity and the eradication of their historical memory In 1991 we were delighted to finally achieve our independence but at the time we did not realise that freedom and independence are not the same thing P Today we are once again fighting for freedom and defending our independence We are doing so not just for ourselves but also for our children who like French Lithuanian Polish and British children have the right to live in a free country It was our children who spent long nights standing on the square in Minsk after the elections on 19 March when the adults could not stand the cold and returned to their homes It was our children who were thrown into closed lorries suffocating and imprisoned while their parents spent days looking for them It was our children who having been released from prison were expelled from universities for their choice of conscience But not for one moment did they doubt the justice of our common choice I am proud of them P Throughout the week following the elections when we were remaining on the square and protesting against the outrageous falsification of the results of those elections the authorities arrested more than a thousand people Minsks prisons had never been full to bursting that was exactly what happened during that week The regime realised that that protest movement could only be ended by military force That is why during those few days the authorities arrested everybody who came to the square even those who were simply bringing food water and warm clothing to the people living in the tent city P On 19 March the authorities did not expect to see tens of thousands of people coming out despite the threat of reprisals That was our first victory I am very well aware that we will need many more similar victories before we can put an end to that illegal regime P The former presidential candidate Mr Aliaksandr Kazulin is now in prison sentenced to five and a half years He has now been on hunger strike for more than 50 days His state of health is extremely serious he has lost 40 kilos and his life is in danger This prize is also for him and for Zmitser Dachkevitch Pavel Seviarynets Mikola Statkevitch and Andreï Klimaǔ and all of the other political prisoners in my country This prize is a sign of Europes awareness of the situation in Belarus This prize is a wonderful example of moral politics This prize is a recognition of Belaruss European future P This high distinction today could have been received by the person who was the leader of the Belarusian democratic movement for several years Professor Hienadź Karpienka Or by the former Internal Affairs Minister Yury Zakharanka Or by Viktar Hantchar the vicepresident of the last legitimate parliament in Belarus These people are heroes fighters for the freedom of Belarus but they have disappeared without trace or have been murdered These are the methods as old as human hate and as horrifically outmoded as the inquisition that the Belarusian authorities currently use against their opponents P In his speech on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize Andrei Sakharov said I am convinced that international trust mutual understanding disarmament and international security are not possible without an open society with freedom of information freedom of conscience glasnost the right to travel and the right to choose ones country of residence I share that view The academic Sakharov always preached nonviolent resistance I agree with him in that regard too We have everything we need to win faith in Belaruss European future solidarity courage and experience For many young people blue the colour of the European flag has become a symbol In March that flag was raised alongside our white red and white national flag As a sign of those countries solidarity with us the flags of Lithuania of Ukraine of Poland of Russia of Estonia of Azerbaijan and of Georgia were also flown P We must conquer the fear that has impregnated peoples consciences over the last ten years as a result of constant propaganda Andrei Sakharov issued a warning Freedom of thought is the only safeguard against the contamination of people by collective myths which in the hands of perfidious hypocrites and demagogues can turn into a bloody dictatorship P That is what is happening today in Belarus Monuments to the glory of Stalin are reappearing Resurrecting the best traditions of the Soviet system the official media endlessly pours out torrents of lies and slander as in Sakharovs era The main enemy is the West and local democrats are depicted as its agents P The regime is in a difficult situation today Its planned economy is not efficient and Russia is threatening to put an end to economic preferences For that reason the government is getting nervous and is trying to blame its political opponents At the end of November at his meeting with Ukrainian journalists Mr Lukachenka stated that this opposition sneaks abroad to call for the application of economic sanctions against the country and is then happy that gas prices are going to rise tomorrow P I would like to take this opportunity to state from this European platform taking full responsibility and to everybody particularly the Belarusian people that these are lies We have never called for economic sanctions against our country and we are perfectly aware that such sanctions primarily hit the ordinary citizens of Belarus The regime in power will always find ways to sustain its officials We have always stated that Russian gas would no longer be cheap for Belarus that it was going to become expensive in Russia itself It is a shame that the Belarusian leaders have not taken the opportunity that had presented itself and that they have not taken advantage of the possibilities they have had for a long time to carry out real economic reforms Now the Belarusian people are going to suffer the consequences P The main conditions that Moscow currently imposes on Mr Lukachenko in return for their longstanding economic and political support include joining the monetary union effectively the Russian rouble and the adoption of the constitutional act of what the Russians call the Union State Accepting these conditions would inevitably mean a loss of sovereignty for Belarus P The Belarusian political leaders are currently still resisting a move in that direction Mr Lukachenka has recently openly expressed his concern about the countrys independence He talks about the link which Belarusian democratic forces have been talking about for a long time between independence and wellbeing But in his case defending independence must not be confused with defending his personal interests and his desire to hold on to power at all costs He and his entourage are perfectly aware that with the loss of independence and the arrival of Russian capital in the country very few of them would keep their positions or their wealth We cannot rule out the possibility however that led by an instinct for selfpreservation the Belarusian regime will accept Moscows conditions and call a referendum to approve them There can be no doubt that only democracy rather than dictatorship can guarantee Belaruss independence P The fact that we have not so far found a common language with Moscow does not mean that the Belarusian democratic forces are against Russia We want to live in a sovereign State and build the best possible relations with Russia We are prepared to take account of its interests provided that they do not run counter to our own interests Russia is a strategic partner for us as it is for the EU A democratic Belarus will be a credible and reliable friend to Russia P We believe that banning entry to the countries of the European Union for people violating the Constitution and participating in repression is a very effective measure This list of enemies of democracy should be extended P At the same time I would appeal to you not to increase the cost of Schengen visas for Belarusian citizens From 1 January 2007 the cost of a Schengen visa is expected to be EUR 60 For the overwhelming majority of Belarusians who desperately need free contacts with the West that cost would be prohibitive That decision is in danger of creating a new iron curtain These measures will benefit Mr Lukachenka who is always telling the Belarusian people that nobody wants us in the West P We were very pleased with the European Commissions proposals last month They offer Mr Lukachenkas government a good opportunity to leave behind the international selfisolation and the poor economic situation that it is stuck in Aliaksandr Lukachenka himself was obliged to acknowledge at the meeting of the government that next year will be catastrophically tough If the regime accepts these proposals Belarus will be able to receive considerable support for the launching of the political and socioeconomic reforms that have been so necessary for so long and to begin a genuine rapprochement with Europe including by means of gradual economic integration P However there is practically no hope that the Belarusian Government will accept the course of rapprochement with the European Union There have already been plenty of similar proposals but the regime has never responded in a positive concrete fashion Its faithful are perfectly aware that once it is launched democratisation will inevitably and very quickly put an end to their stranglehold The current leader of Belarus would never win genuine free elections P At the same time this European Union proposal offers us the opportunity to make the citizens of our country understand that despite what the State propaganda says Europe is leaving the door open to Belarus but to a free and democratic Belarus These proposals have appeared at a very appropriate time during the local election campaign There will be no genuine elections just as there is no genuine local government in Belarus Within the context of that campaign we are distributing information on the European Unions proposals P We appreciate your assistance very much and we thank you most warmly for it I would however ask you to extend it and make it more flexible We are talking about things that are already wellknown assistance for free media support for civil society and for repressed people The European Unions current programmes are drawn up for countries that are already moving towards democracy and carrying out reforms but they cannot work in the case of Belarus In order to promote democracy in countries such as mine it is high time that a European Fund for democracy were created with real resources geared towards countries with dictatorial regimes Europe must not shrug its shoulders and say what can we do about it There is a lot you can do You can help us to break down the barriers to information and the restricted view of the world imposed upon my fellow countrymen by government propaganda to create a public space conducive to open debate amongst the citizens bringing together independent authors intellectuals and moral authorities This will undoubtedly help civil society in Belarus to develop more quickly P Europes recent message to the Belarusian people was both a demonstration of your solidarity and a reminder to the current regime of its responsibility for its crimes The most important thing however is that that message should make clear that our country belongs in Europe It is my profound conviction that Europe will never be complete without Belarus That is why we repeat the same slogans as my ancestors who rose up against tyranny for the sake of freedom For your freedom and for ours P As a Belarusian and a citizen of a European country I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart and I also thank you on behalf of all of those people who were on the square in March and those who have been or still are in prison for defending their fundamental right to live in a free country I thank you for having faith in our victory I promise you that our victory will not be long in coming My country has changed It is less afraid and it believes in change P Belarus will soon return to the European family and will once again be a free and democratic State Historically dictatorships have no future and as history shows they end badly for the tyrants Under a dictatorship the only real option is to fight simply because we have no other choice Thank you for your support and long live Belarus P Parliament stood and applauded the speaker Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen Thank you Mr Milinkievitch P The European Parliament is proud to have awarded you this Prize and is sure that the words you have spoken today will go down in history P Applause P The sitting was suspended for a few moments while awaiting the continuation of the vote",

tabled over the past five years and the document currently contains 1 000 of them I would just like to make two brief points P The first is that I would like to extend very warm thanks to the rapporteur Mr Sacconi and to the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done which was a massive job to tackle and they did it splendidly so my heartfelt thanks for that P Applause P That Mr President promptly brings me to my second point which is to ask just what has emerged from the trilogue We met with the Finnish Presidency of the Council on five occasions the meetings were not always totally straightforward and they were once briefly interrupted What came out of them is before you today in the shape of Amendment 191 which is at the heart of what todays vote is about and for the sake of a compromise into which this House has put so much of itself in a way it never will again I urge you to vote in favour of it To our friends in the Group of the GreensEuropean Free Alliance I will say that the other amendments will lapse or must not be allowed to jeopardise this important and valuable compromise Mr President ladies and gentlemen I should like to make it clear first of all that I am sitting in this seat not because there has been a palace coup within the Socialist Group in the European Parliament but for logistical reasons to make it easier to give voting instructions P Mr Florenz the committee chairman has already mentioned the essential points about the content and the difficulty in reaching the outcome that we achieved in the agreement with the Finnish Presidency It is now my job to say that this outcome is like a fresco painted by a team of artists many people have been involved I recall that ten parliamentary committees have worked on it In particular two committees have cooperated very closely with the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety I therefore thank Mrs Ek and Mr Nassauer the draftsmen for those two committees Then I thank all the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on the Environment Ria OomenRuijten Chris Davies Carl Schlyter and Caroline Lucas Jens Holm Johannes Blokland and Alessandro Foglietta as well as the secretaries of the committees and political groups P We have encountered five presidencies the British Presidency at first reading and now the Finnish Presidency have played particularly decisive roles We have also got to know a number of Commissioners because REACH was launched during the previous parliamentary term The Commissioners responsible then were Mr Likanen and Mrs Wallström and now they are Mr Verheugen and Mr Dimas P We have therefore seen many things had a great many opportunities for discussion and distilled all that work into todays conclusion I have not the slightest doubt that this Parliaments sense of responsibility will confirm our decisions and at last make it possible to send out a strong message to Europes citizens REACH will be up and running on 1 June 2007 P Some may say that the result of all this is not a brilliant product but in the meantime it will start operating and I am sure that it will produce highly significant results for peoples safety for health for the environment and not least for the competitiveness of European industry P Applause P Following the approval of option 1 Mr President ladies and gentlemen this excellent result for which I thank this House will now be followed by a series of amendments not covered by the compromise P I will agree with many of the amendments but it is quite clear that voting for and adopting them would mean forcing us to go through conciliation for the sake of some marginal points and that would really be the wrong thing to do as it would put back the application of the regulation P Applause IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen on a point of order I should like to point out to the Chamber that in respect of this debate two speeches have been made in which voting instructions have been given during the vote P Please this is a sensitive moment and the positions of those who are going to vote in favour of the amendments for example should also be respected P Applause P Before the vote on Amendments 176 and 178 SV Mr President the rapporteur said that there will be conciliation if these amendments are adopted We do not know this for a fact however If we approve the amendments the Council may well accept them but we will not know this until COREPER has made a decision There is thus no automatic link between adopting the amendments and conciliation P Applause P Before the vote on the common position Mr President ladies and gentlemen I should just like to say thank you once again P In this House today I think that Europe batte un colpo as we say in Italian it has scored a victory on a very sensitive subject for the people and for the companies involved P Applause",

    "input": "Moratorium on the death penalty debate The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the moratorium on the death penalty Mr President ladies and gentlemen what I have to talk to you about today is one of the most fundamental components of the European Unions policy on human rights and the many motions for a resolution tabled by the various groups in your House indicate just how live an issue this is P Taking as its basis the guidelines for the EUs policy in respect of third states and the death penalty as adopted in 1998 by its Council of Ministers the European Union is campaigning worldwide for the abolition of the death penalty under all circumstances and the declaration of moratoria has for some years been a consistent feature of that campaign albeit not as its main objective but as an intermediate stage on the way to the practices abolition once and for all P The European Union will continue its policy of protection for human rights under German Presidency and will therefore be arguing forcefully for moratoria on the death penalty and for its permanent abolition P That means that we will on the one hand continue to pursue the debate on the issue of principle not only on bilateral contact but also in multilateral fora the United Nations in particular whilst also on the other hand continuing to be proactive in approaching those countries that are at a turning point that is to say those in which either positive or negative trends are perceptible as regards the death penalty and to bring influence to bear on them by means that is of very definite demarches in many urgent individual cases P I am aware that your House has been a constant advocate for this policy and am glad to be able to say that we have already together achieved a great deal The fact that in something like twothirds of the worlds countries the death penalty has been legally abolished or is in practice a dead letter is attributable to the sustained efforts of all active campaigners against the practice and I am happy to be able to stress that active involvement in the Council Europe has played its part Thirtythree states have now ratified the 13th additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights the effect of which is to outlaw capital punishment even in time of war P I would also like to mention however that there are still too many states numbering 66 that continue to carry out executions along with some regrettably retrograde trends when it comes to the observance of moratoria This is why it is so important that we should be unstinting in our efforts and should aim our arguments for the abolition of the death penalty at international fora and elsewhere P The European Union submitted resolutions to this end to the Human Rights Commission from 1999 until the Commissions dissolution in 2005 and over that period it proved possible to secure stable majorities in favour of them Since that body was dissolved we have had to seek new ways of moving the debate on the abolition of capital punishment forward although it has to be said that since there are no easy answers to this our actions have to be very well thoughtout if and this is a priority we are to avoid being obliged to retreat from positions already secured P On this line there has up to now been firm agreement in the European Union but we have up to now refrained from putting a resolution to this effect to the UN General Assembly in view of the continued high risk of it not being supported P Instead on 19 December at the European Unions initiative and for the first time ever a unilateral declaration against the death penalty was put to the General Assembly and it is important to note that it was supported by 85 states from all parts of the globe Encouraging though this result is it does also confirm that the chances of a resolution from the EU meeting with success in the General Assembly cannot as yet be seen as 100 certain P What then is to happen next It is clear to all partners in the European Union that we want to continue to actively promote the cause of the campaign against capital punishment at the United Nations and elsewhere but I would at the same time like to make it clear that this is still a very difficult area and so any campaign against the death penalty will only meet with success if the European Unions actions are step by step and well thoughtout P Our watchword should continue to be that the possibility of a new EU initiatives failure should be excluded as far as possible for a defeat for the European Union would be a victory for the advocates of the death penalty and hence a reversal in the fight against this inhumane mode of punishment something that we do not want and must not allow to happen I believe that we will also find supporters It is for that reason that some of the principal players among the nongovernmental organisations Amnesty International being one of them advise against precipitate action and are reminding us that insisting again on this subject being debated in the General Assembly of the United Nations could turn out to be counterproductive for the European Union P Agreement was therefore reached at the General Affairs Council of 22 January that we would first devise a well thoughtout approach that would progressively enable us to present our concerns more effectively to the United Nations The ambassadors in New York and Geneva were therefore mandated to do everything possible and without delay to bring forward a debate at United Nations level P It will also be necessary to draw on the experience and current estimates of the relevant NGOs as to what further steps to take in combating the death penalty at UN level P This will then enable the Presidency of the Council to make proposals in February to the EU partners as to further action This I regard as a first and important step and I hope that we will find others willing to support us in this course of action P Applause Member of the Commission Mr President I also welcome this opportunity to exchange views on the issue of the death penalty and on the means to promote the universal abolition of this odious practice P As you know the abolition of the death penalty worldwide represents a key objective of the external human rights policy of the European Union and I am personally committed to seeing the EU continue to play a lead role as we have just heard in this global effort Since all of us here agree on the ultimate goal of our action in this field namely universal abolition I wish to provide some thoughts on this process of abolition and on the means to reach our common goal P Firstly let us not forget that the experience of abolition on the European continent has been a slow often tortuous and protracted process which has been for most of our Member States driven by a combination of strong political leadership and a mature level of development of human rights protection the rule of law and democratic institutions With some notable exceptions including the United States of America and Japan the global map of abolitionist countries also closely follows that of democratic pluralism Visionary leadership and political courage are key to abolishing the death penalty These efforts often need to be bolstered by a dynamic and open nationwide debate to ensure that the ultimate political decision to abolish the death penalty in a country is also a permanent one P In the Philippines and to some extent Kyrgyzstan the recent abolition of the death penalty was precisely the result both of remarkable courage on the part of the political leadership and a profound nationwide debate which witnessed wide participation from civil society actors which has been mentioned and institutions In the United States of America there are also some encouraging trends in some states like New Jersey and Maryland P On the other hand it is not excluded that a country falls back into the practice of death penalty as we unfortunately have witnessed in Bahrain and need to fear in Peru And in many other countries our appeals to abolish the death penalty have fallen on deaf ears until now P The execution of Saddam Hussein and his henchmen has now sparked a renewed debate on the death penalty The horrific videos of his undignified end upset even some supporters of the death penalty But let us not forget that every year thousands are executed most of whom are certainly somewhat better people than Saddam and many are even innocent Their deaths should outrage us even more P While evidently the abolition of the death penalty in any country is to quote Robert Badinter a victory of humanity over itself one must remain realistic as to the influence of external actors such as the European Union in this process because this process remains first and foremost a domestic one P This is not to say that the European Union will sit on the fence On the contrary the EU has been and will remain at the very forefront of international efforts notably at the United Nations as was mentioned to fight the death penalty Last December the EU presented a Declaration on the Death Penalty at the UN General Assembly which received the support of a record 85 states In line with our guidelines on the death penalty the European Union has carried out numerous demarches on individual death penalty cases including in countries such as the United States of America Iran and Indonesia and will continue to do so in the future The EU is also the leading source of funding for abolitionist projects run by civil society and over the past ten years we have spent over EUR 15 million supporting such projects around the world P The European Parliament and civil society actors have traditionally played a crucial role in both supporting the abolitionist efforts of the European Union and in stimulating the debate on the means to enhance our policy It is of prime importance to listen carefully to those voices when discussing possible initiatives in various international forums as the Council is currently doing P This has certainly been illustrated most recently by the Italian proposal for a universal moratorium on the death penalty at the UN General Assembly Without prejudging the final outcome of this process of reflection I wish to share three observations made by abolitionist actors on the moratorium which have struck me as relevant for feeding todays discussion P While representing a key element in the EUs strategy towards universal abolition leading NGOs have stressed that a moratorium is not a panacea They claim it is by essence fragile reversible and must be followed by abolition in law They refer to the example of Kyrgyzstan where the regularly extended moratorium on executions has not prevented the number of prisoners on death row from increasing I think we need moratoria that hold firm P Secondly some NGOs underline the fact that the moratorium is one abolitionist tool among others I agree that in this context the promotion of the Second Optional Protocol providing for abolition the support for legal counselling for death row convicts and other efforts have to be included in our toolbox Hence we should avoid the current discussion on the moratorium to eclipse the fact that abolition is a multifaceted process P Lastly when bringing the issue back to the UN General Assembly we need to be cautious as to the possible outcome It is paramount to secure a positive result We need to be alive however to the risk of an ambiguous or even a counterproductive outcome and the Council Presidency has alluded to it given international divisions on this subject Failing in such an effort could have negative consequences which will be difficult to repair Therefore we need to assess the situation and possible scenarios thoroughly before moving P In conclusion I wish to underline the importance of maintaining a common EU approach towards the universal abolition of the death penalty The Commission will spare no efforts to work with the Presidency and Parliament to this end on behalf of the PPEDE Group ES I believe that Commissioner FerreroWaldners words clearly indicate the model of Europe we want to see a Europe of values P If I had briefly to paint a picture illustrating what the European dream has been over the years I would have no hesitation in stating at this sitting Madam President that the idea of Europe represents a permanent call for peace understanding harmony and solidarity and that in addition to a legitimate vision of Europe such as the Europe of financial perspectives the Europe of the tangible the Europe of net balance and net contributor I believe that there is a higher vision of Europe which is the Europe of values P It is precisely within this context and in accordance with this vision of a Europe of values that this initiative is seeking a universal moratorium on the application of the death penalty P It must be of a universal nature because fundamental rights and the right to life in particular must not be preached for one region one country or one continent but they must clearly be of a universal global nature P We must therefore celebrate the fact that in 2005 and 2006 a whole series of countries such as Liberia Mexico the Philippines and Moldova have decided formally to abolish the death penalty I believe that we must continue to work tirelessly to ensure that the seventy countries that still apply the death penalty join the 128 countries that no longer apply it P Madam President I would like to say that if the European Union is to preserve that moral and ethical leadership that it has been exercising it is essential that we fight to ensure that democracy the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and in particular the right to life prevail in all regions of the world this year and over the years to come Madam President ladies and gentlemen the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow and this evenings debate situate the European Parliament in that international movement that is appealing to the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution for a universal moratorium which is a first step towards the general abolition of the death penalty from the statute books of every country P As has been said we would like the Council of Ministers to actively commit itself to achieving this objective the Presidency is very committed and we hope that this point remains one of the priorities of its term of office The same commitment has been made by the Council of Europe and the European Commission P From what she has said Mrs FerreroWaldner does not actually seem to me to be very convinced of the fact that as a first step we need to go through a moratorium I on the other hand would emphasise this point and I would ask Mrs FerreroWaldner Would not going through a moratorium bring abolition any closer I do not think so this could therefore be a first step not least because the European Union in its international relations could bring to bear the extensive relations it enjoys in the context of the neighbourhood policy the association agreements and the strategic partnership and in my opinion Europes political parties could also do their best within international forums to ensure that their organisations put pressure on the participating countries P I believe that the aim is to banish the death penalty from the statute books of every State an act that would among other things help to ensure that the United Nations enjoys a reputation for being an institution that safeguards universally recognised rights Madam President ladies and gentlemen I shall confine my speech to a statement and a note issued this morning by the German Presidency Word for word the note reads the German Presidency calls on the governments concerned to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty with immediate effect I am reading the note from the German Presidency This is precisely our position P I think I am right in saying that Mr Barroso also issued a statement fully supporting the Italian initiative the aim of which is to have a proposal for a moratorium drafted within the current UN General Assembly This proposal will undoubtedly win through as far back as 1999 there was an absolute majority in favour of a resolution which was not tabled P Faced with the enthusiasm that we are seeing throughout the world right now for our initiative that of the European Parliament of the chairmen of our groups the initiative that was preannounced very specifically in Strasbourg by Mr Watson and other Members I therefore do not understand or rather I understand only too well how it is possible to stall at a time when France is taking the incredible step of highlighting the abolition of the death penalty with a change to its Constitution when Rwanda is also doing so and when just yesterday Kyrgyzstan did so Statements are coming in from everywhere from Syria from Lebanon in support of our position I believe that in the future the European Parliament like the Council of Europe before it will lead this movement P To conclude my speech Madam President I should like to point out that 60 years ago there was a RomeBerlin axis I was 10 years old and I remember it well It happens today that with the comingtogether of the German Presidency the Italian initiative and the very recent French initiatives a new situation is emerging I believe that it is historically important that in a certain way Berlin and Rome are now taking a definite stand with no hypocrisy or fear of winning because there are too many people here who are scared of winning not losing Madam President last week during the debate on the Benghazi case we stated our total opposition to the death penalty under any circumstances It is now important to reaffirm this principle which is enshrined in Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights P The Union has always advocated the abolition of the death penalty and has even gone so far as to make it a condition of accession and a key principle of its foreign policy Moreover guidelines were adopted in 1998 and civil society projects are regularly funded under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights This effort has been rewarded the number of executions in the United States has gone down and in countries like Mexico Liberia the Philippines and Moldova the death penalty has been abolished P The same is not true everywhere however Some US States have extended the scope of the death penalty to other crimes apart from murder in Singapore a person is still automatically sentenced to death for carrying 15 grams of heroin and China still executes more people than any other country In addition there are countries like Iraq and Afghanistan which have reinstated the death penalty Peru almost did likewise in the name of combating terrorism but fortunately this did not happen P Against this backdrop and ahead of the developing world congress against the death penalty the EU must be extra vigilant The international groundswell of opinion in favour of a universal moratorium on the death penalty should be addressed within the framework of a proabolition policy Ensuring the ratification of the second protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aimed at abolishing the death penalty should therefore be one of the Unions priorities It is crucial that France Latvia and Poland which have yet to ratify the protocol do so at the earliest opportunity on behalf of the GUENGL Group IT Madam President ladies and gentlemen No one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed No one may be removed expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment This is what is laid down by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and this is what makes me indeed I believe makes us proud to be part of the European Union It is the upholding of human dignity it is realising that no one can rule another persons life and that there should be no revenge only justice This should be true for all courts including military ones P Too many countries still have the death penalty and they include not only large countries such as China but also the most important military and democratic power the United States which has still not been able to leave its Wild West culture behind P I hope that the Congress against the Death Penalty being held in Paris in which we as Parliament will take part will be a further step on from the moratorium on the way to abolishing the death penalty and eradicating poverty around the world I also hope that the people who take to the streets of Paris will be a warning to all those who even in Europe are thinking of bringing back the death penalty In any event it is these street protests that will lead to the UNs approving the moratorium in full on behalf of the ITS Group NL Madam President countries where capital punishment still exists do not deserve to be part of the civilised world no matter whether these countries are Islamic where adulterous women are stoned the America of Bush India the worlds largest democracy or Communist China I will therefore not hesitate to back the plea for a worldwide moratorium One judicial error the life of one innocent is enough to write capital punishment off as barbaric Allow me though to add two observations P Respect for life should not stop a constitutional state from giving serious offenders effective and irreducible penalties of 30 years or lifelong imprisonment for that matter This condition must and indeed can underpin the publics consensus against the death penalty This consensus will not come about unless our citizens who are increasingly faced with the most brutal forms of crime add their voice to the worldwide abolition of capital punishment P Secondly some opponents of capital punishment should display a certain degree of consistency For example on a recent friendly visit to China which is a singleparty state the French Socialist Presidential candidate sang the praises of the efficiency of the Chinese justice system This efficiency involves the families of the thousands of people who have been sentenced to death every year being presented with the bill for the bullets that killed the victims but Ségolène Royal did not spare a thought for them After all they do not bring in the contracts because the commercial interests of major enterprises in China must be protected and that is when some European opponents of capital punishment go all quiet all of a sudden If Europe wants to retain its credibility it should exert pressure on countries such as China whatever the political or commercial cost IT Madam President ladies and gentlemen I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party The execution of Saddam Hussein has put the spotlight back on the debate on the death penalty a debate that is absolutely timely although it must not be used for tactical purposes and above all it must not be a subject that is raised on and off This is first and foremost a battle of civilisation and progress P We do not just have here an essential guarantee for individuals a request for the inviolability of individuals to be further strengthened we are also faced with an historic and universal need a global milestone and focal point for 21stcentury civilisation P It has been said and I agree that after the abolition of slavery in previous centuries and the ban on torture the right not to be killed following a court ruling should be another common denominator a new and inalienable dimension of humankind that makes a community of us all Today this Parliament is sending out the first clear message along these lines Mr President I want to support the strong calls from this Parliament today and the campaign outside Parliament for a worldwide moratorium on executions to be established unconditionally through a resolution of the UN General Assembly P For many years the EU has maintained as a main pillar of foreign affairs and human rights policy the objective of ending the use of the death penalty globally We have had some success particularly as part of our neighbourhood strategy Todays initiative is an ambitious attempt to raise the profile of the debate on the death penalty to a UN level and to have an impact on the 66 countries that have already been referred to that still use the death penalty It is important to note that working towards achieving a moratorium on the death penalty should always be linked to achieving an eventual abolition through legislation as previous speakers have pointed out P The pragmatic first step is a call for a moratorium but we must always look at ways to promote abolition where possible Looking at what we can do here in the EU from a policy perspective I would urge the Council to review and update the guidelines on the death penalty which date back to 1998 so that new elements and strategies that have developed since then can be taken into consideration The Third World Congress on the Death Penalty which is to be held soon in Paris may be a good opportunity to do just that P To date the EUs proactive policy on the death penalty has produced some positive results For example recently the success of strong EU representations in Peru to recent proposals to extend the death penalty to that country in violation of the Peruvian Constitution and the American Convention on Human Rights needs to be acknowledged and welcomed The EU stance did have an impact on the Peruvian Congress in its rejection of draft legislation So the EU has shown that it can be a key influence on national policy towards the death penalty and we should not be afraid to use that influence ES Madam President yesterday Robert Wilson of 24 years of age was sentenced to death by a jury in New York This is the first death sentence to be handed down in that State for 50 years P This is another tragic example of the current threat to the universal values that we are all defending here today despite the very significant progress that has been made in countries such as Liberia Mexico the Philippines and Moldova P We must however continue to fight to ensure that others such as China with around two thousand official executions per year eight thousand according to unofficial data join the global moratorium and suspend their executions P We must support Iranian civil society which is rising up against the death penalty Iran has one of the highest numbers of executions 177 in 2006 Furthermore it has broken the moratorium on stonings and it currently has six women sentenced to death by stoning P Above all we appeal to the United States a country whose decisions have an immense impact on global politics to support the Italian initiative to establish a universal moratorium on the death penalty which will be approved with this Parliaments support I hope in the United Nations General Assembly P As other speakers have said here today the moratorium is a first essential step towards abolition This is probably one of the most important challenges facing the human race at the beginning of this century Madam President worldwide 20 000 people are on death row waiting to be killed by their own governments Sadly over 3000 of these are in the United States I do not single the US out because it is the worst that is China with 80 of executions but because we have hope of the Americans The great prize would be for a change of mind in the United States and the signs are there The number of executions in the states of the US has dropped dramatically since 1999 there were 277 in that year and 128 in 2005 Twelve states have now abolished the death penalty not including Texas which clocks up an unimpressive onethird of the 1100 executions in the US in the last 30 years P I think the Commission and the Presidency need to be more proactive and less hesitant in seeking a moratorium and abolition worldwide through a UN General Assembly resolution As in some other areas of human rights policy like extraordinary rendition and waronterror abuses the EU is not always as effective in putting its principles into practice as Parliament would wish EL Madam President as we speak all the Member States of the Union have ratified the sixth protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the abolition of the death penalty We also nourish the hope that it will be abolished both by law and in practice in all the countries of the world be it in times of peace or in times of war with the result that there will be an improvement in respect for human rights and human dignity will be reinforced as the Council and the Commission emphasised today P Allow me however to ask you if you were concerned about the human rights and dignity of the dictator Saddam Hussein and his fellow detainees who became food for the entire worlds voyeurs Is this the role of the European Union as a global stability factor P What can you say about the statements by the British foreign secretary Mrs Becket who emphasised that Hussein simply got what he deserved and that justice was done P What are European citizens supposed to believe when they read the condemnatory statements by the Council on the one hand and hear the derisory comments by the ministers in it on the other We need to get our act together because we are ultimately just fooling ourselves Madam President I must say that the arrogance of this EU knows no bounds Not satisfied with dictating to Member States that they must not avail of the ultimate deterrent the death penalty it now wishes to dictate to the rest of the world P Awful as the fate of the Bulgarian nurses in Libya is and while this House should be vigorous in protesting against their situation it does not justify us demanding a global ban on the death penalty Wrongful imprisonment is intolerable but it does not lead rational people to oppose all imprisonment No I say that if there is a fair transparent human rights compliant judicial system with a reliable appeal process then a sovereign nation state is perfectly entitled to deploy the death penalty for capital crimes if that is the democratically expressed wish of its people They not we have the right to choose what is right for them IT Madam President I am delighted to take the floor because among other things I come from Tuscany where for the first time in history on 30 November 1786 capital punishment was abolished I am also moved to point out that in 1987 I together with Amnesty International and the Italian Movement for Life succeeded in having the death penalty of Paula Cooper a 16yearold black girl commuted in the United States She later came to thank me P I am also pleased to point out that as an Italian Member I proposed and achieved the legal abolition of the death penalty in the military code of war which is the reason for my indepth thoughts on the matter I take an optimistic view of human history which in spite of everything is a struggle for goodness a struggle that is spurred on by an ever more obvious and decisive value the dignity of each and every human being So great is this dignity that it cannot be graded and thus it determines the equal status of everybody no matter what kind of life they lead Dignity is also indestructible not even the hands of a criminal can wipe away the traces of dignity from the face of the very man who has committed the crime P No one can take away a persons life and dignity not even individual States That is the real reason why the death penalty must be abolished All the other practical reasons of which I am only too aware may meet with objections but not this one A Europe that seeks to base its identity not only on competition and the market but also on dignity and human rights cannot keep quiet P Right now I do not want to talk about inconsistencies The time will come when human dignity and the associated right to life extend their persuasive powers to other areas of human life where they are now sadly being overshadowed even within our Union the most symbolic areas of poverty and human alienation which are to be born and to die ES Madam President rejecting the death penalty is not a question of moral superiority nor of lecturing anybody nor of collective pomposity on the part of Europe It is consistent with a basic belief in human dignity many years experience of the utter pointlessness of capital punishment and fear of the serious and perfectly welldocumented risk of its being applied unjustly even if in only one specific case and there have been many of them regrettably P Europe must apply itself to what is possible without forgetting the ultimate objective What is possible is to demand a moratorium courageously throughout the world beginning with our closest partners without forgetting I would insist the ultimate objective which would be the global abolition of the death penalty P We must protest against the death penalty but that must include the death penalty on Saddam Hussein as well as the death penalty on the person sentenced in the United States following a trial with practically no defence for a crime he committed when he was underage P Those death sentences Commissioner must be condemned just as vigorously as the death sentence on Saddam Hussein we must not have double standards because if what we are advocating is to fight the death penalty those more or less anonymous prisoners who have had practically no right to defence deserve our support even more than a criminal such as Saddam Hussein PL Madam President the political religious and legal debate on whether or not to apply the death penalty has been under way for decades and will continue into the future The famous writer Albert Camus spoke out against it in his time and Robert Badinter a former French Justice Minister led a legal battle at European level for many years As a rule strong ethical arguments are adduced in heated debates of this nature and references are made to the inalienable right to life Horrifying statistics about the number of sentences carried out in countries such as China or India are also quoted The largest democracy in the world the United States is placed in the dock Catholics opposed to the death penalty and those in favour of it contrive to base entirely contradictory arguments on the same sources namely the Gospels the Catechism and Papal encyclicals It is very difficult to justify to the families and loved ones of people often children who have been cruelly murdered that the death penalty should not be applied to those responsible for the crimes At such times peoples emotions incline them to desire a very different outcome P I hail from a country that suffered under the iron rule of Hitlers totalitarian Nazi regime and later under Soviet Communism I would like to point out that use of the death penalty is a key feature of each and every dictatorship When I look back at events in my country Poland during the period to which I previously referred I see how whole legions of Polands finest sons and daughters were murdered following sentences handed down by Communist kangaroo courts Having considered both sides of the argument concerning the death penalty I am bound to say that its abolition is essential in order to curb the madness of fanatics prepared to use the legal system to eliminate their opponents The most the fellow citizens of these murdered heroes can do years later once freedom has been restored is to put up monuments in their honour P This is what I have learnt from the history of my parents and grandparents generations and also of my own Only one of the 1 500 death sentences carried out in Poland during the Stalinist period involved a common criminal The price of restricting the actions of dictators of various political hues may well be that instead of being guillotined offenders who deserve this ultimate punishment will have to spend the rest of their lives in prison without the opportunity of parole If that is the case I believe it is a price worth paying however painful it may be to do so LT The death penalty is the most offensive method of killing because it is done with the approval of the community These words of George Bernard Shaw pronounced almost a century ago are being endorsed by an everincreasing number of people and a majority of countries Unfortunately the natural human right to life is still ignored by 68 countries The death penalty is most often implemented not only in Asia but also in the United States The execution of Saddam Hussein I would say has become a display of impotence We are now presented with an exceptional opportunity to work hand in hand with the Italian Government to seek abolition of the death penalty in every country of the world Opposition to the death penalty is one of the values that unites EU countries therefore the Unions voice carries weight The United Nations General Assembly will I hope support the proposed moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty and its abolition should be the ultimate goal At the same time it is essential to condemn the statements of some official representatives of the new EU countries about the possibility of legitimation of the death penalty World public opinion needs to be channelled in the European direction PL Madam President Article 1 of Additional Protocol No VI to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms reads The death penalty shall be abolished No one shall be condemned to such a penalty or executed This protocol was laid down back in 1983 and underpins the thinking and actions of the Member States of the Union It is also the stance adopted by most Members of the Council of Europe Essentially these are European standards for the protection of human rights The question as to whether the abolition of the death penalty is only relevant to Europe is a rhetorical one Clearly the answer is no Every individual has but one life and that life deserves to be protected We must therefore support a UN moratorium on the death penalty We are aware that the death penalty is rooted in a culture of revenge and retribution from which mankind needs to break free It is very easy to delete the death penalty from criminal codes All that is required is the legislators will to do so It will be much more difficult for us to detach ourselves from it at an emotional level to recognise it as an unethical penalty and banish it forever from human consciousness However we must be aware that if we fail to do so we shall have to go on asking ourselves whether in the 21st century man can continue to kill his fellow man in the name of the law PL Madam President the European Union has consistently advocated a ban on the application of the death penalty since 1998 In October 2003 the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the European institutions and Member States of the Union to put pressure on the UN General Assembly to declare a moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty The European institutions and Member States of the Union must ensure that the issue of the death penalty is dealt with again at the current UN General Assembly Acting on behalf of the European Union the Member States must aim at tabling a draft resolution on a general moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty with a view to its abolition They should garner maximum support for this resolution amongst the Member States of the UN The European institutions and Member States of the Union should do all in their power to secure as soon as possible a favourable outcome in a vote at the current UN General Assembly EL Madam President the fact that broad agreement between the political party has prevailed in todays debate confirms that the European Parliament can act as the guarantor of European democratic civilisation and for the protection of human rights human dignity and the right to life P It has been proven that the death penalty not only does not prevent crime but also feeds hatred and violence The civilised world cannot respond to the barbarity of a criminal act with the barbarity of death P We welcome the initiative by Mr Prodis Italian Government and the backing being given to it by the president of the Socialist International Georgos Papandreou All the Member States of the European Union should certainly ratify the voluntary UN protocol the 13th protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights I would say however that the Member States should incorporate a provision abolishing the death penalty in their internal constitutional order P To close I should like to say that we should not overlook the fact that today in European society there is a large percentage of citizens who are still in favour of the death penalty and as such we must also work in this direction together with the European Commission with programmes working through democratic consultation to convince European society PresidentinOffice of the Council DE Madam President Commissioner what has become apparent from this debate is how great a consensus exists as regards what is one of the most fundamental objectives of the European Unions policy on human rights Frequent reference was made in it to the Italian initiative about which there must be no misunderstanding When talking about this initiative we are not talking about the whether of it or about what it is intended to achieve but rather about the how where and of course the when of it in other words about the procedure rather than the substance P You Commissioner made that very clear earlier on At the General Assembly on 19 December last year a unilateral declaration was read out and 85 states endorsed it encouraging though that is we must also on the other hand consider and bear in mind the question of whether our objective is capable of being achieved at all in view of the fact that to date this declaration has gained the support of only 21 out of 47 members of the new Human Rights Council in Geneva To put it bluntly we do not yet have a majority for it P The situation in the United Nations third committee is similar As I said in my statement earlier there are now various fronts on which we have to take the initiative The General Affairs and Foreign Relations Council too has come up with a strategy for achieving the goal to which all of you in your interventions have referred and although we do not at present know when we will be able to implement it I can assure you that we will support you in your efforts that is something on which we the Commission and the Presidency are agreed for we too are endeavouring to do away with capital punishment for ever Madam President I endorse what the PresidentinOffice Council has just said I think there is widespread consensus in this House and between all the EU institutions on the substance of todays debate and where we want to go but sometimes we have to see what the next tactical step is P I want to clarify that the Commission is certainly favourable to the introduction of a moratorium as an important intermediate step towards the complete abolition of the death penalty We of course support the Italian initiative and Parliaments motion for a resolution but we have to see and this is at stake the tactical nature How can we ensure that the planned UN General Assembly initiative will be successful We need to ensure very good preparation We have to reach out to all the UN members and we need pertinent timing for the launch of the initiative of such a worldwide moratorium P We are also quite active not only at UN level but also at bilateral level we try to do that be it in China or Peru I have for instance written to the Peruvian President to express our deep concerns and hopefully there is still a chance to block it P I would also like to thank Parliament because it also has possibilities It has used them in the past and maybe it can use them even more by talking to the different delegations Very often as I said before it is a domestic issue and the more Parliament can talk to parliaments the better we can influence this I have received six motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 1032 of the Rules of Procedure P The debate is closed P The vote will take place on Thursday at 1130 pm",

    "input": "New PNR agreement SWIFT debate The next item is the debate on P the oral question by Pervenche Berès on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and JeanMarie Cavada on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs to the Council on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B600012007 and P the oral question by Pervenche Berès on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and JeanMarie Cavada on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs to the Council on the new PNR agreement and SWIFT B600022007 Mr President Commissioner honourable Members we now turn from such fundamentally demanding issues as energy and climate change to discuss another very important matter that has in the past demanded your attention here in the European Parliament and also that of the European Union as a whole not merely on one occasion but repeatedly and the issue to which I refer is that of the sharing of airline passengers personal data P As we all know following the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 the United States enacted legislation according to which airlines running flights into and out of the United States must permit the US authorities electronic access to the data in their automatic reservation and processing systems the material known as passenger name records and should the airlines decline to comply they are threatened with the withdrawal of their landing rights P I would now like to briefly remind the House of the state of play In May 2006 the European Court of Justice had in response to an appeal by your House declared null and void the Council decision on the agreement between the European Community and the USA relating to the forwarding of passenger data to the US authorities and likewise the Commissions decision on the appropriateness of the data protection measures P The ECJs fundamental justification for its decision was the European Communitys lack of power to conclude any such agreement since it was not within the sphere of the first pillar It had nothing to say about the material question of whether the data was sufficiently protected P As you will be aware negotiations with the USA on a successor agreement proved to be highly problematic but it was nevertheless eventually possible to conclude them with an interim agreement due to expire on 3 July this year which is on the basis of the third pillar and of the USAs undertaking given in respect of data protection which had already been taken as a basis to the earlier agreement between the European Community and the United States P At the beginning of January 2007 the Commission made a recommendation to the Council to the effect that it should approve the commencement of negotiations with the USA on a new passenger data agreement that should replace the present interim one The EUs negotiating mandate for the Council Presidency which the Commission endorses was today discussed by COREPER and the prospect is that the Council will adopt a resolution on the subject and lay down negotiating guidelines in February P It is likely that the negotiations on a new passenger name record agreement will prove to be extremely difficult since there is no evidence of any interest on the part of the United States in improving data protection Indeed it seems far more likely that they will claim that their undertaking in respect of data protection no longer applies The conclusion of an agreement is however essential in terms of the standard of data protection that is to be guaranteed and in the interests of the European Union for in the absence of an agreement the airlines would be under great pressure to pass on the passenger data in order not to risk losing their right to land in the USA P The German Presidency of the Council will with the Commissions support be pressing for a legally watertight arrangement that secures the protection of data taking the interests of the passengers and of the airlines into account and maintaining a high level of security and I would like to stress that it is in this taking due account of the positions of your House as expressed in the relevant resolutions of September last year on data protection on the combating of terrorism and also on the defence of human rights P This subject also brings me to speak in response to the oral questions put to me by Mrs Berès and Mr Cavada on the subject of SWIFT The Council wishes to thank them for their interest in this dossier in relation to which it has already had the opportunity to answer questions from your Houses Members on various occasions As regards my answers to these questions I would refer the honourable Members to my statement P In December 2006 the Council informed the Members that the questions they had raised demanded careful examination the Council is still engaged in doing this and its inquiries have not yet been completed In the remainder of this speech I shall be endeavouring on behalf of the Council to answer the various questions put to me by Members of your House although all the matters to which I can refer are still subject to the Councils inquiries P In a speech in July 2006 the Finnish minister for European affairs as the then PresidentinOffice of the Council announced to the plenary that the Council was not at that time able to confirm press reports of an exchange of information between SWIFT and the American authorities She reminded your House that finding out what had actually happened was a matter for the national authorities and went on to state that the European Union was then and would in future be prepared to act if it turned out that events made legislation at the European level necessary P As I have already mentioned the Council and the Commission are currently still engaged in examining every aspect and every issue of potential relevance to this dossier while also taking the outcomes from the data protection group into consideration The Presidency is giving thought to how the work on this at Council level might be organised and will in so doing take account of what emerges from the current investigations but what I can tell you is that no new group has as yet been appointed with this purpose in mind P Since investigations are still ongoing the Council is at present unable to answer the question as to whether these matters will impact Regulation 1781 of 15 November 2006 on the information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds The Council has no knowledge of whether or not the Commission is considering submitting any proposal for the amendment of this Regulation but I am sure that we will learn that when the Commission makes its statement P Under the Treaty it is the Commissions function to monitor the implementation of Community law in the Member States and to take appropriate action as and when a Member State fails to discharge its obligations under EC law P Reference has also been made to the automated targeting system an American system affecting the transport of freight and persons within the United States and from and into them Whether data obtained from SWIFT have been fed into this system is one of the questions currently being examined P When it stated that an international framework for combating terrorism was already in place the data protection group was referring to the working party on fighting money laundering and the funding of terrorism and the recommendations made by it The Council believes that good work is being done within this framework although it has to be said that this groups recommendations are addressed to banks and financial institutions P While I am on this subject I would like to stress speaking on the Councils behalf that SWIFT cannot be regarded as a financial institution for this working partys purposes and that the Financial Action Task Force framework is therefore not directly applicable except possibly to certain specific aspects That concludes the Presidencys statement on behalf of the Council VicePresident of the Commission Mr President I shall begin by addressing PNR As you all know the temporary agreement concluded in October with the United States will expire by the end of July this year in a few months time There is therefore the need to negotiate a very solid and stable legal framework which will enable the exchange of PNR data with the United States with full respect of data protection and privacy rights P As the Presidency of the Council just said the Commission has recommended to the Council that it authorise the Presidency assisted by the Commission to open negotiations on the basis of a set of negotiation directives I am confident that these recommendations will be examined very soon I personally strongly hope that by midFebruary we will get a negotiating mandate to open this very difficult exercise P The Commission is recommending to the Council to strive for full respect of fundamental rights notably the right to privacy I have said on a number of occasions that the right to privacy is for me nonnegotiable It has to be respected fully and completely Legal certainty is also an important element for aircarriers It must be taken into account as it has been from the very beginning As I have already stressed in this Parliament several times the Commission is committed to continuing to give due consideration to privacy on the one hand and legal security on the other as they form key principles of this file without forgetting the importance of preventing and fighting terrorism and related transnational crimes The negotiations for a new agreement with the United States on PNR data are a key priority for the Commission and for me personally and I understand from what the Presidency of the Council just said that it shares this view I warmly welcome the close cooperation between the Commission and the Council Presidency which is crucial if we want to succeed if we want to speak with one voice On my side of course as usual I will keep Parliament informed as this work progresses You know very well that as it was in the past for me it will be a political commitment though this document for example the negotiating recommendations once approved will be classified as EUrestricted P The negotiations will present a real challenge for Europe It will require imagination it will require a lot of common effort from all the EU institutions and from the United States as well in order to reach a very robust solid solution P To conclude I would like to see for example this Parliament together with the United States Congress following the political phases of this very difficult exercise making perhaps for the first time a joint political commitment which would be particularly useful for the ongoing negotiations However it is up to you to decide P IT I shall now refer ladies and gentlemen to the SWIFT matter which has also been addressed by the Presidency You will recall that a few weeks ago before the Christmas holidays I informed the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs that the SWIFT case needed to be addressed from a European perspective and I said on that occasion that we would begin an exploratory dialogue with the US authorities in order to address both the general issue of data protection and the specific issues raised by the use of SWIFT data by the US Treasury P You will probably be aware that these informal yet important discussions have already begun I am in favour of finding a European solution to addressing this issue a European solution that ought in my opinion to include clear rules and precise guarantees which the US Treasury should endorse and include in its documents In other words the two points at stake are as ever legal protection for personal data that are transferred and legal certainty for all parties concerned and I must say legal certainty for banks too for as the Presidency has clearly highlighted SWIFT is not a bank P It is quite clear then that when I talk about guarantees from the US authorities I intend to specify in which circumstances for what purpose and by whom these data may be known and used I would say right away that it must be made clear that the purpose is restricted solely to terrorism investigations and thus to preventing the funding of terrorism so that we avoid the albeit indirect risk of such data being misused for example for economic espionage purposes P It is also clear that there seems to be a need for a further restriction and that is to link the use of these data to research on specific individuals who are suspected of terrorist activity In other words there should be no nonspecific transfers of data without suspects who warrant further investigation having first been identified P You are aware of the letter that I wrote to all of the Member States in November asking for information about the conditions under which their banks use personal data through SWIFT Only seven Member States have so far replied to my request for clarification This is unfortunate and I will obviously be asking for a reason in certain cases in the specific case of Italy for example it has requested more time to respond In other cases there has simply been no response P From the seven responses that I have actually received although no general conclusions can be drawn from them because too few Member States have responded it emerges that banks normally use personal data for the sole purpose of executing payment orders and that they were not informed in such cases of the fact that personal data are transferred to the US Treasury by SWIFT Therefore the general response given is simply that they are not aware of the fact that someone namely SWIFT transfers data after having received it from them However it has emerged but you already knew this that in many cases central banks had been informed precisely by the US Treasury of the transfer of data from SWIFT Europe to SWIFT United States and from SWIFT United States to the US Treasury P You are aware that actions and further investigations are being carried out by the national data protection authorities with the aim of shedding some light on the issue and of finding out whether apart from the Belgian case which is now well known there are other specific cases in which national data protection authorities can open a file and thus start proceedings Clearly as soon as I have some information in this regard I will pass it on to you as I have done in the past P There is a specific question concerning the possibility of applying the Automated Targeting System to SWIFT data On the basis of the technical explanations given to me it would appear impossible or highly unlikely for the system in question to have been used for processing SWIFT data for the simple reason that it is part of the Department of Homeland Security which relates to the protection of borders and thus to the movement of people passing through the US It was not surprising that the European Parliament asked about the application of this mechanism to PNR data SWIFT data are in a totally different category because they come under a different administration which is the Treasury P The question submitted also asks whether the Commission is aware of other examples of US authorities requesting data from private parties in this sector I have no information on that and so I cannot answer that question There is no doubt however that while the fight against the funding of terrorism is a vital instrument for preventing terrorism this fight cannot undermine or limit a fundamental right such as that of customers to have their personal financial data protected As you know one of the violations uncovered by the Belgian authorities and the European Committee for privacy protection is precisely the lack of prior information for customers which coincides with what the banks said since they had not been informed of these transfers either P To conclude Mr President ladies and gentlemen I believe that there are two reasons why we need to work towards a European instrument Firstly we cannot limit or destroy our EuroAtlantic collaboration in relation to the fight against terrorism that would be a serious mistake which I believe the European Union should avoid making Secondly we must also point out to our American friends that it is in everyones interests for fundamental rights and the protection of personal data to be scrupulously adhered to If by virtue of having a European instrument we succeed in doing the same thing that we are trying to do with the PNR even though the two issues are very different the principle is the same and find a European solution that prevents differences in treatment between one EU Member State and another in relation to the United States I believe that it will be possible to strengthen the European Unions negotiating power and to demonstrate at the same time that our aim is to strengthen the EuroAtlantic link not to weaken it author FR Enriched by the lessons of the case of passenger name records PNR we should be able to make quicker progress when it comes to SWIFT I should like if I may Mr Gloser to correct you on one point I believe that this is the first time we have held a specific debate on SWIFT here in the Chamber and this is no doubt in the normal course of things but I do hope this debate will enable us to make progress P SWIFT is not an undertaking that operates solely in Europe or solely between Europe and the United States It operates everywhere To put it simply after September 11 the nature of relations between SWIFT and the US authorities changed beyond all recognition and we are now seeing the consequences not only in terms of data protection for the EU but also in terms of the balance that should be struck between data protection the fight against terrorism the security of payment systems and protection against economic espionage P The Commission has acknowledged that there is a problem and has begun to put forward proposals In a recent letter addressed to Mr Cavada and me the Central Bank also recognised that the time had come to enter new phases without going too far in the proposals This confirmed what it had said to us at the hearing which unfortunately neither the Council nor the Commission saw fit to attend The Central Bank had told us at the hearing that it bore very little responsibility for what had happened in the case and the letter partly confirms that view P Reading the memorandum concluded between SWIFT and the US Treasury in April 2004 it is very clear that there was awareness of the data protection issues involved in the manner in which SWIFT transferred information to the US Treasury Just as a train driver bears some responsibility for his train and the post office bears some responsibility for what it carries SWIFT must bear some responsibility for the data it passes on P The key point here following the hearing held jointly by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs last October is the briefing of the Article 29 working group which on 22 November 2006 clearly confirmed our concerns namely that in the SWIFT case data that should manifestly not have been concealed from the US authorities had in fact been concealed and that accordingly the 1995 Directive had not been complied with P We should like to thank the Commissioner for taking the initiative of calling on the Member States to rectify without delay the issue of noncompliance with the 1995 Directive but as he himself also said the results up to now have been quite poor The European Central Bank for its part has heeded the lesson that it should demand customer consent That remains a very prudent thing do P As regards this last question there are two points we must raise The first is the nature of transatlantic relations and the manner in which data are used in something of a spirit of free unbridled competition on the US side and on the European side we have experience of this in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs sometimes with a degree of naivety P One would like to think that these data are used solely for the purposes of combating terrorism We dare to hope so but we have no proof Commissioner Mr PresidentinOffice of the Council if there is a message that I believe Parliament would like to convey to you when you hold talks with the Americans on the issue it is that the purpose of the talks must not be to validate the current state of affairs as regards the transfer of data via SWIFT It should be to ensure that the level of data protection and the concept of data protection itself that we have here in the EU are respected and accepted Everything leads me to think that the task facing us in this area is a tough one but you can count on Parliaments unwavering support P Just one more minute Mr President to address the last aspect which is the issue of the status of SWIFT As SWIFT is a Belgian company we are always being referred back to the Belgian State That being said the fact that SWIFT is a Belgian company is because we are in a legal vacuum It is clear that SWIFT is doing a job that should really be done by a Europeanlevel body overseen by a European supervisory body I believe that in this area too Commissioner Mr PresidentinOffice of the Council you need to proceed on the basis of new information Parliament is once again ready to discuss this matter but we cannot accept the current state of the debate author FR Mr President there is an expression in French to describe the surreal confusion of an institution when it finds itself faced with an unexpected situation We say that it behaves comme une poule qui a trouvé un révolver like a chicken that has found a revolver P Frankly Mr Gloser without wishing to underestimate you the least we can say is that your position on this matter is extremely disappointing I therefore feel entitled to remind you that your mandate is to defend European sovereignty something of which I have seen little sign so far As you will have appreciated we are therefore disappointed and above all worried P I will talk firstly about PNR data In a few months time as we know as you have said and as Mr Frattini has pointed out the interim agreement on air passenger data will expire We have no clear information on how it is working I would also like to point out that when the previous agreement was annulled by the Court it was based on an assessment of the adequacy of data protection in the United States This is not the case with the agreement in force however even though this assessment is required by the protocol to Convention 108 of the Council of Europe which is binding on the Member States and hence directly or at least indirectly on the European institutions Having a dubious basis the agreement has not so far been properly implemented since the data transmission system that should have been in operation since 2004 the push system is not yet operational and that is despite the announcements made most notably last September P In a spirit of cooperation I would like to ask certain questions publicly Firstly I wonder whether the Commission should have applied more pressure in order to ensure that the push system was implemented by the airlines and electronic reservation centres that it monitors Secondly I wonder whether effective information for air passengers should have been demanded with regard to the use of their personal data for security purposes in the same way that information campaigns have been carried out on rights in the event of delays or flight cancellations for example P For our part with regard to this dossier we are awaiting clarification from the Commission and above all from the US authorities on a number of points I shall mention two of these First of all we do not understand why in order to fight terrorism and organised crime it should be necessary to have all thirtyfour pieces of data listed in the PNR and not just the nineteen pieces of data that Parliament and the data protection authorities had deemed sufficient for that purpose P Secondly how can it be that European citizens and passengers could have been classified as dangerous for years unbeknownst to them without us demanding anything in return P I shall now turn to the SWIFT system This second issue is even more delicate and it concerns the American authorities access to data relating to financial transfers My fellow Members have already dealt with a number of points I shall therefore just express the views of the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs At stake here is the protection of our citizens fundamental rights and the credibility of our partnership with the United States It is really incomprehensible that no reciprocal arrangements have been proposed in order to negotiate with a partner even if it is a friend Will we one day act in the same way with another partner to the east of our borders Russia I would therefore like to say that European sovereignty is not being respected P In agreement with the political groups therefore I have taken the initiative to invite the competent committees of the American Congress and I am awaiting a response P The President asked the speaker to conclude P I understand perfectly well that Parliaments timing is extremely important and since I am confident that my colleagues will say everything else that needs to be said I will stop there I have said the most important things I wanted to say I honestly thought that I had five minutes I am of course very sorry Mr Cavada but unfortunately when we organise our parliamentary business it is essential to abide by speaking times in general so that we can proceed especially in the case of minisessions when times are accordingly short The Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats is working towards consistent compliance with the acquis communitaire and all the documents that uphold the values of European civilisation and protect the freedom and personal integrity of each individual We are opposed to any unlawful conduct which restricts such freedoms and works against the individual P We recognise however that protecting peace and security also imposes certain constraints For this reason we believe that any intrusion into personal privacy should be kept to a minimum and be conducted on a legal basis On the basis of the documents that are available to us there is a wellfounded suspicion that access to the data held in the SWIFT System could represent an illegal intrusion into personal privacy So please allow me to put to you the following questions P First I would like a detailed answer as to which data held in the SWIFT System are available to the US authorities and which data are they entitled to access on that basis P Second do the US authorities have access to all the transactions carried out in SWIFT branches in the USA and can they through these or other SWIFT branches also gain access to transactions carried out outside the USA P Third I would like to ask the Commission the Council and the European Personal Data Ombudsman whether accessing the data held in the SWIFT System represents a violation of the provisions on data protection and consequently an illegal intrusion into personal privacy P Fourth at the October hearing we did not get any convincing or sufficiently clear answers on the competence of institutions with respect to SWIFT So I would like to ask who is actually competent to rule on the SWIFT issue and on what legal basis P And fifth I am interested in the principles underpinning our negotiating platform with the USA on these issues and whether within that framework we will also learn how the US authorities make use of the data obtained and what dangers are involved in data leaks and abuses P Mr Coelho will address the PNR issue Thank you on behalf of the PSE Group FR Mr President the controversy surrounding the transmission of personal and banking data by SWIFT to the US law enforcement authorities and the judgment on the EUUS agreement regarding PNR data have demonstrated the urgent need to draw up a global framework for the transmission and protection of personal data within the context of transAtlantic relations P Europe understands the United States increased need for security and we want to enhance our cooperation with our American partners with a view to fighting terrorism effectively Having said that it is also essential to deal with the protection of fundamental rights and privacy within the framework of transAtlantic dialogue We are in favour of reaching a new PNR agreement but it must be respectful of fundamental rights and provide guarantees on the protection of European citizens privacy That is why we want the Commission to communicate to us the details of the proposed mandate for the negotiation of this new agreement The European Parliament must be fully involved in this process P Could you also provide us with more information on the work of the highlevel working group on the sharing and protection of data We would also like to know about the priority proposals recently put forward by our American partners P With regard to SWIFT the Belgian data protection authorities and the Article 29 Working Group believe that this transmission represents a violation of the Belgian and European rules on the protection of personal data So far no concrete solution has been proposed to put an end to this violation All of the actors involved agree that it is urgent that a European solution be found a solution that is respectful of fundamental rights and which companies can implement properly The European institutions must ensure that the payment system in the European Union provided by SWIFT complies with the Community legislation on data protection P We would therefore ask the Council and the Commission what measures have been taken to resolve this problem Are there plans to negotiate an international agreement similar to the PNR agreement You tell us that the Commission has held a dialogue with the American Treasury department with a view to finding a solution Can you tell us what solutions have been studied Furthermore at our last debate on the same subject you informed us Mr Frattini that a questionnaire would be sent to the Member States in order obtain all possible information on this transfer of information Have you really received all of the necessary replies and how are you going to follow up on that questionnaire P Furthermore in 2006 within the codecision procedure Parliament adopted its Alvaro report on the regulation stipulating the personal data that must accompany transfers of funds and under what conditions The transfer to a third country of banking data that does not have a specific link with that country clearly falls outside of the scope of the regulation and may represent a breach of the fundamental principles of data protection P For the same reason given that the transfer of the SWIFT data does not just involve data relating to transactions between Europe and the United States but also data relating to transactions within the European Union it would appear to be clear that this issue belongs in the first pillar An agreement pursuant to Articles 24 and 38 of the European Union Treaty would not be an appropriate solution We cannot accept an agreement to legalise current violations on a case by case basis SWIFT has no legal obligation to use a mirror site in the United States Would it not be possible to find a solution in another country in order to move that mirror site to one that contains European data as the Article 29 Working Group suggested P Finally SWIFT PNR and also the Automated Targeting System ATS and perhaps in the future telephone data demonstrate that the exchange of information is intensifying and the urgent need to draw up a common framework for protecting the privacy of European citizens Do you not believe that the European Union should take a global approach to these issues in order to establish general principles for the transmission and protection of data with our American partners on behalf of the ALDE Group Mr President I am always very touched when I hear how attached the Council and the Commission are to involving Parliament because it is indeed true that in the area of counterterrorism policies the decisionmaking is profoundly undemocratic because it totally excludes the European Parliament and national parliaments are only very partially involved P Therefore I would have a solution to offer you and that is not just to make solemn pledges here before the House but to actually consult Parliament on a voluntary basis on the mandate for negotiations on PNR and SWIFT because that would not only lend democratic legitimacy to such a mandate it would also actually strengthen your negotiating position because frankly although I have a high appreciation for the officials who do the actual negotiations I think matters of such importance should have a political mandate P Secondly I fully agree with the remarks made by Mrs Roure on the need for global standards on data protection People who think that we are antiAmerican are wrong I have actually seen how attached the Americans are to their privacy laws which are very good and how critical they are when the public authorities do not respect the rules on privacy So I think we should take their critical attitude as an example P I would like to know if Commission and Council are aware of other categories of data being accessed by the US authorities not only passenger data and SWIFT data but also for example telecommunications records and insurance company or social security records and if not by the US authorities by other countries If you are not aware of this maybe you should start investigating P With regard to PNR SWIFT and ATS I will not repeat here all the expectations that we have of the PNR negotiating mandate That has been said already But I would like to know why the Commission and the Council did not bother to insist on a second joint evaluation of the implementation of the PNR agreement before agreeing on a new negotiating mandate Would it not make sense to first evaluate how this one works and how effective it has been before we start talking about the next one P I would also like to know what the state of play is with regard to the switch from push to pull which was scheduled for December 2005 then for December 2006 It is now January 2007 Where are we on this point P I would also like to know what the state of play is with regard to information to passengers I have been travelling myself lately and I could not get any information on the matter P I would also like to know on what basis the European Commission will actually be negotiating an agreement on SWIFT P Finally with regard to ATS you get a letter from the Department of Homeland Security saying Do not worry we comply with the PNR agreement as we understand it I am not a lawyer but I think that is rather a funny formulation It does not reassure me and I would like further reassurances about profiling and datamining Does it take place I should like to know about the discrepancy with regard to storage periods and about purpose limitation What other data are being fed into this and what are the exceptions as regards the privacy act Mr President ladies and gentlemen this extensive legalpolitical debate involves the fundamental issue of European sovereignty as the chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs has also rightly pointed out Consequently there is a factor that has not yet been referred to that should not be left out which is the statements made by the highest US authorities I do not think they have been challenged but they are worth mentioning P The SWIFT system which we are analysing in relation to European law has certainly had the merit of cutting short some atrocious terrorist initiatives it has made it possible to uncover or has helped to identify the perpetrators of the London bombings in July 2005 and it has at least led to the capture of key players such as the terrorist Hambali who seems to have been the brains behind the Bali bombing in October 2002 It should certainly also be said that the publicity surrounding this procedure has in all likelihood led many terrorists to give up using such methods P On the other hand it is undeniable that when the SWIFT society was faced with a contract involving both European law and US law it confined itself to negotiating data protection mechanisms with the US Treasury Department without obtaining further safeguards P This is a problem that must be addressed as is the problem of the European Central Banks role and responsibility The ECB had been informed about the issue right from the start and it played a leading role in this instrument I shall not go into the matter of its transparency Before the Committee on Civil Liberties the ECB through its president Mr Trichet sheltered behind the confidentiality agreement among the ten banks and also claimed that it had not been able to give SWIFT its blessing because that was not within its power P What then we wonder are the powers of the ECB if it does not have power in a situation like this one This is a very important point and I think we will have to thoroughly reexamine the ECB and its transparency on behalf of the VertsALE Group NL Mr President ladies and gentlemen Mrs in t Veld may be unwell physically she is still in excellent form verbally That being so I should like to carry on where she left off P I still feel that we are very much running behind the facts When it became evident that the United States collected credit card data as well as other personal data from our passengers it was a scandal and we as MEPs wanted a regulation in place and in most cases the governments did not want anything except that if rules were broken they wanted this to be done quietly eventually they were forced into a form of action With SWIFT we saw a repeat of past events the government mounted a lowlevel investigation which will hopefully culminate in some sort of action and the question is indeed are we now entirely convinced that this is it The Commission is quite clearcut when it says that although it is not in any event aware of any developments it does not rule them out either I should like a response from the Council to this Do you consider it conceivable and what will you do now to know for certain We are always saying that we are partners with the United States which is true for that is what we are and we have a great deal of work to do This also means though that you are entitled to know what your friends are getting up to I would therefore like to find out from the Council how it intends to address the issue in order to know exactly what data are being collected of our citizens in all kinds of areas P According to the Council it is hard to conclude a fresh agreement because the United States is not so keen on this data protection There is however a limit to the level of blackmail we are willing to accept You cannot say that we have to reach agreement at any cost if at a given moment in time the price we need to pay is too high It could in fact be quite funny once we have sunk as low as we can to draw the line at some point This may imperil the landing rights but will at the same time mobilise quite a bit of opposition including in the United States because it is true that although the US administration would very much like to force this through there is much support for our position among the parliamentarians on behalf of the GUENGL Group DE Mr President Mr Gloser Mr Frattini I have to say how astonished I am that in your remarks about the PNR negotiations you made no mention of the Automatic Targeting System ATS P I for my part wonder how it can have come about that a system like ATS which was originally designed and implemented for freight could for years have been used in conjunction with PNR data for passengers and this without anyone knowing P While we have been negotiating agreements with the United States in order to guarantee the protection of our citizens fundamental rights a system such as this has at the same time been operating behind the scenes The USA now assures us that ATS is compatible with the present as well the previous PNR agreements That being said I want to state very clearly that assurances of this kind are not enough for me For me it is not obvious how 40 years data storage using the ATS system is compatible with the PNR Agreement P There is also the fact that ATS can apparently be used for any old purpose How then can this be compatible with the obligations under the PNR Agreement whereby PNR data is only allowed to be used for the purpose of combating terrorism and other serious crimes P We have not so far received any convincing answers to any of these questions any more than we have to the question of why the ATS system was kept secret at all How during the negotiations for the PNR Agreement could the United States conceal such essential information from its partner One would probably be justified in asking how it might be guaranteed that there are no further ATSstyle systems that we simply know nothing about P With regard to the new PNR Agreement I should expressly like to support what my fellow Member Mr Cavada said namely that the number of transferable items of information about airline passengers needs to be significantly reduced It must be guaranteed that the US customs and border protection authorities are not just passing on data willynilly to any old authority involved in the fight against terrorism P What is more we must as the European Union insist that European citizens be given the same opportunities for safeguarding their rights as are American citizens on behalf of the ITS Group NL Mr President I should like to take a stand against the black and white terms in which this debate is all too often held It also appears some of the time that the United States is an enemy instead of an ally in the fight against terrorism One may well deny it but just about every measure that has been taken has come under fire from this House P It is of course the case that the SWIFT case evokes a number of justified questions which Members from various groups have already asked Where for example do you draw the line between tracking down terrorists and respecting fundamental rights It is a question in fact that has also been put to the American Congress P In the final analysis the fight against terror is largely related to risk analysis the calculation of probability in other words The processing of commercial data on top of personal data pure and simple can make a useful contribution in this respect What we must do though is to put guarantees in place to prevent misuse For example among other things this House must monitor the functioning of the system as well as the algorithms that are used which moreover have to be highly confidential sanctions must be put in place in the case of misuse the information obtained may be used only for the purpose of combating terrorism and there must be a call centre where complaints from the public can be handled P It goes without saying that this requires a great deal of consultation with the United States A clear legal framework is needed and in creating one all partners must be open to fresh ideas and new techniques PT I should like to begin by saying that I see the United States of America not as an enemy but as a friend and partner in shared fights Of course in our shared fights we must pay particular attention to combating terrorism but it is also important to mention that in some of these fights the US Administration has at times gone too far both at internal and international levels and I am chairing a European parliamentary committee to look into some of these excesses on the international stage P It should also be noted that the US Congress has undergone a shift of balance which has led the US Administration to pull back from implementing some of its more controversial plans at internal level and I hope that this will have an effect at external level too This to my mind means that the USA is clawing back its good record of placing the emphasis on civil liberties which is a good thing P Mr Frattini has reminded us that the demands of security must not undermine the values of essential freedoms and in particular data protection and Mr Cavada rightly pointed out that the amount of data requested is excessive Does Parliament want to know what data is involved Who can have access to it How can we ensure that objectives are limited and that data are not used for other purposes With whom can they be shared For what length of time can they be kept Then there is the issue of the push system as mentioned by previous speakers and the question of peoples rights to appeal in the event of the misuse of their personal data P Previous speakers have said that if we in Europe offer US citizens the same level of personal data protection that we offer European citizens under the principle of reciprocity we are legitimately entitled to claim the same namely that European citizens in the USA should enjoy the same level of data protection as that offered to US citizens EL Mr President the debate on the PNR agreement SWIFT and secret CIA abductions and flights unfortunately highlights a philosophical divide between America and Europe The US Government considers that the fight against terrorism warrants any means Europe does not However the recent elections in the USA now give the European Union the chance to negotiate a new PNR agreement from a different position of strength with many more allies among the people of America and Congress itself Let us hope it will do so P In order to achieve the objective of an agreement which protects fundamental rights it must inter alia P Firstly insist that the USA makes an explicit undertaking to provide full and effective personal data protection as opposed to the current unacceptable practice of a nonbinding and unsatisfactory protocol P Secondly restrict the number of data items currently transmitted to the USA many of which have little to do with the legitimate objective of identifying terrorist suspects P Thirdly ban the use of data for purposes unrelated to the fight against terrorism P Fourthly expressly stipulate and limit the US departments which will be entitled to access data P Fifthly ban at long last the right of direct access in the USA to airline company files We must bring this saga to an end P Sixthly and finally make provision for the European Commission and the European Parliament to have the facility for constant direct and effective control of the strict application of the USAs obligations and to stop immediately any investigation that infringes the intended purpose We have even been told by a private company by SWIFT that they demanded and achieved this in its negotiations with the USA There is no excuse for twentyseven European prime ministers to be unable to negotiate and achieve this If they do not it will be a question not of I could not but of I would not and we shall all rightly judge them at that point DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen data protection has high status in the EU It was therefore a shock for us to learn from the media and from the American media at that that despite the data protection requirements documented in all the EU Member States SWIFT was prepared to give in to pressure from the United States and to forward data concerning European citizens to Washington This happened without the knowledge never mind the agreement of the European Parliament the national parliaments or the individuals concerned P To date we have not been able to examine the memorandum of understanding between SWIFT and the United States that forms the basis for transferring the data We can only hope that the data has in actual fact been used only for the purposes of combating terrorism and not for example for economic espionage We do not to date have any confirmation of this We all support and appreciate the need for determination in fighting terrorism However individuals fundamental rights must be safeguarded Emphatically the fight against terrorism must not be conducted to the detriment of basic civil rights and the right to data protection P That is a particular concern of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe too and that is why we requested a hearing on this issue It did not surprise us that the Americans who were also invited stayed away from the hearing without saying why P We welcome the prompt and thorough investigation by the Belgians who have come to the clear view that a violation of rights or as Commissioner Frattini put it a criminal offence has taken place Incidentally the people responsible at SWIFT either knew or at least suspected and feared this from the beginning and they have indirectly informed us that they did so P The failure of corporate governance at SWIFT is still incomprehensible to me The supervisory bodies were informed but did nothing to enlighten people as to what was happening or to tell the governments about it With the best will in the world that is no way to treat politically mature citizens Peoples confidence in the EU as a legal community has been badly damaged The SWIFT case is leading to an increase in Euroscepticism in the population and it will be difficult to win back the confidence that has been lost P I would ask the Council and the Commission to conclude the careful inquiry of which Mr Gloser has spoken as quickly as possible and to present practical proposals as to how the rights of European citizens might be enforced in respect of the United States too You should show people that you are not kowtowing to the United States but take the European Union seriously as a community of values and courageously defend it in relation to major partners too and precisely because they are friends rather than enemies PL Mr President the European Parliament was quite right to become fully involved in monitoring the routine transfer of European Union citizens personal data to the United States Control by the European Parliament is acceptable Refusal to transfer data is not It seems that data transfer can be justified on the grounds of the terrorist threat posed mainly by Islamic extremists Nonetheless such a threat cannot be perceived and exploited as a good pretext for the uncontrolled and unrestrained restriction of citizens rights We must not become extremists ourselves We must not retreat from the front line of the war against terror under the banner of citizens rights On the other hand we need to control those who would like to control us in the interests of that war I refer to the monitoring our flights financial affairs and privacy If the justifiable war against global terrorism is not to transform into a dictatorship and a war against citizens freedoms it must itself be subject to strict scrutiny by the European Parliament DE Mr President we need a thorough assessment in the runup to an agreement Central to this will be the issue of the effectiveness not only of the present agreement but also of the previous one This question must be answered before we can make further progress in this matter P Any future agreement must be based on the push system The pull system is no longer acceptable since as is well known the push system ought already to have been introduced in the previous agreement The transfer of passenger data needs to be strictly limited in terms of the purposes for which such data is used Otherwise we cannot contemplate such a regulation P The future agreement must also be given full democratic legitimacy a process that should involve the European Parliament and if appropriate the national parliaments P We also need an annual evaluation as a necessary component of any agreement and the evaluation reports must be publicly accessible Clearly the rules governing personal data need urgently to be protected under the third pillar as do global standards covering all the categories of personal data DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen I very well remember the statements by Chancellor Merkel in Strasbourg in which she rightly spoke of European values and also about our need to get across to people and make it clear to them what Europes strong points are P Mr Gloser this would appear to be a case in which we should explain to people that the European Union helps them safeguard their rights We are not concerned in this instance with the issue of combating terrorism There is consensus in this House on that matter and it does not need to be discussed Where however do we stand then in this debate We began by discussing airline passenger data and now we come on to SWIFT In view of the speed with which the Council debate is currently being conducted it is to be feared that over the next few years we may possibly have further SWIFTs to contend with but we still have not made further progress P In the meantime we have a situation in which under pressure from the United States a European company signs a memorandum of understanding with the Americans which Europeans are unable to scrutinise Moreover SWIFT still does not even have a registered office in the United States but only a data bank That is sufficient for American regulators to be able to take SWIFT to task in Belgium This is like a running theme There is more and more American regulation of European affairs appropriated by the United States without we Europeans managing to adopt corresponding countermeasures and to monitor the effects of these P I would therefore bearing in mind that Germany does not only have the Presidency of the European Council but also chairs the G7 urge the Commission to take an active stance in this area and as well as investigating matters to resolve one issue how on the basis of our common values and while adhering to data protection requirements and safeguarding human dignity are we to join together in combating terrorism Mr President of course the reality of this is that on PNR the Americans are setting a negotiation bar for conditions of entry into the US or into their airspace That is the reality They can set the bar as high as they like We have citizens who wish to travel and businesses who want to work there That is the reality P The reality on SWIFT is that we had an institution not I believe the only institution that was dealing with a conflict of jurisdictions operating and holding data in the US and equally in the EU It had subpoenas which it legally had to meet in the United States of America and that was where we had the conflict SWIFT I believe has actually operated and negotiated an excellent memorandum of understanding P We can either come into politics to name shame moan and whinge or to try and solve a problem I came in for the latter Therefore I believe Commissioner Frattini you are absolutely right We need legal certainty for EU citizens for EU businesses operating outside the EU and with offices outside the EU as well as within and in which they hold data We need a joint political commitment of Congress and this Parliament working across the transatlantic divide to fight the threat of terrorism which affects us all and indeed we need to protect above all our fundamental rights and freedoms P Therefore I welcome the joint meeting of this House and US elected representatives so that we can reach an agreement P Finally this will only be achieved by decisive action at Council level not just at Commission level I welcome the excellent suggestion of the previous speaker of bringing this up at the G7 P Let us solve the problem let us not moan about it Mr President I should like to thank the Commissioner and the PresidentinOffice for being present at this very important debate We have heard that maintaining good cooperation with the US was crucial in our fight against terrorism I do not deny that I even believe that the transatlantic relationship must be reinforced because terrorism is a global phenomenon We must join forces to fight it efficiently by exchanging information and providing our law enforcement agencies with the necessary means Our citizens have the right to live in a safe and secure place However the SWIFT case is showing us again the drifts arising if we do not ensure strict safeguards when exchanging information There is a correct balance to be struck between freedom and security and in this case security has once again prevailed You cannot combat terrorism by giving up the very rights that terrorism seeks to destroy Our high standards must not be lowered under pressure from any third country even from our closest partners P It is even more important that many of the new Member States have a long history of dictatorship and mass surveillance of their population Unfortunately in some of these countries there is a perception that the illicit practices of the past are still carried on That is why Europe must remain the defender of fundamental rights and that includes the right to privacy On the one hand we need a framework decision on data protection in the third pillar to ensure high standards in police and judicial cooperation We have been waiting for it for too long now On the other hand we must also remain vigilant and ensure that the existing instruments are properly enforced in our own countries We must prosecute those who infringe our basic rights to privacy We need to reassure our citizens that we want to maintain high standards in Europe Mr President as my colleagues have said before this is not a debate about the shape of the transatlantic relations Everyone in this House should know that the United States is our strongest ally in the fight against terrorism But this does not change the fact that if we are partners it makes it easier for us to stand firm and really defend our values and our laws P I can only echo what my PPE colleagues especially Mr Radwan have said in order for us to really safeguard the respect of the European regulatory framework we need full information from the Commission and Council on the information that is delivered to the US authorities and how this information is protected by the US authorities We have to start to negotiate and get an agreement on information exchange which is on a viable basis and which respects the EU laws If this does not happen we have to immediately stop delivering any kind of information to the US authorities P Even after the ECBs response I am quite puzzled as to what the role and the responsibility of the ECB is in this case The ECB itself is subject to the data privacy requirements of EU law but it does not seem to take any responsibility for what it might have in this information exchange P I also understand that there is a clear need for the US to track down information on international bank transfers that might have a link to terrorist financing but these details have a link to other kinds of financing Our European businesses especially might be at risk if we do not act and stand firm The information that will be given should always be in line with our legislation and protect our citizens and European businesses P The national financial transfers contain such delicate information that this is really an issue which should be taken seriously by the Commission and by the Council this Parliament and the US Congress DE Mr President Mr Gloser Commissioner the PresidencyinOffice of the Council should in my view observe the following guidelines in its current negotiations with the United States on the transfer of airline passenger data P Firstly it is through a proportionate approach that an appropriate level of security will be achieved and that approach is not apparent in the case of the current agreements Such an approach depends and this is my second point on implementing compliance with normal European data protection standards and that in my view involves changing the status quo mainly through reducing the quantity of behaviourrelated data Where switching over to the push system is concerned Austrian Airlines has to my knowledge operated this system from the beginning successfully too The system involves having a clearly defined framework for using the data a limit on the period for which the data is stored and not least the ability to lodge a complaint in the event of data being misused P Mr Gloser you rightly said that we need legal certainty as quickly as possible for European airlines As a politician involved in transport issues I can only concur with that Given that the transfer of data really is about making progress in combating terrorism it has an international dimension and we no doubt also need international agreements with internationally binding data protection rules These are what we should be negotiating towards P We must always be concerned to uphold our right to freedom of movement which can only be achieved in an open society in which people can move about freely without falling under general suspicion It would be unacceptable to us as Members of the European Parliament if the principle of equality were to be violated and if different levels of data protection were to apply to US citizens on the one hand and to nonAmericans on the other I have confidence in the determination of the German Presidency of the Council as it conducts the negotiations I know that these will not be a simple matter DE Mr President Mr Gloser Commissioner the fact that you have heard the same refrain right across the political groups should I believe give you pause for thought The message is that we do of course need a transatlantic partnership and that we are allies in the fight against terrorism Not only the refrain but even the verse was the same across the board namely that credibility confidence and transparency are necessary where these issues are concerned P Let us begin with credibility I still remember very well how in his last speech in this House the Commissioner particularly praised the data protection aspects of the agreement I do not believe that such praise is compatible with the rights that we should have from the point of view of data protection law Where the transfer of airline passenger data is concerned there is no duty to provide information and the individuals concerned have no right to correct the data What moreover has happened to credibility when you call the conversations you are conducting with the United States negotiations You are standing with your back to the wall and with a pistol pointing at your chest The United States is threatening no longer to allow aircraft to land and none of the European Unions institutions has the backbone to say that in all good faith we shall not allow ourselves to be treated like that P Credibility is undermined by our hearing again and again that Parliament is to be involved If you are serious about that then include us around the table and in so doing show us that you mean what you say P Turning now to the subject of transparency which European citizens are aware that when they board an aircraft 34 items of data including information about what they have to eat and where they sit are transferred None do I have discussed this very question with citizens in a broadcast No one knows that this is what happens when he or she boards an aircraft P We are on your side so involve us instead of just fobbing us off NL Mr President ladies and gentlemen the SWIFT debate very clearly fits within the wider discussion on the highwire balancing act between the fight against terrorism on the one hand and the protection of fundamental human rights and privacy on the other Not only though is there a clear dividing line between the European and American positions we cannot even seem to agree on a common definition for terrorism The Commissioner has indicated on this platform how he would like to develop a European instrument for the future that would meet these requirements but that is something that cannot of course be done overnight We are indeed left with the situation from the past and present something about which I have quite a few questions To this day data are being passed on as if there was nothing wrong within the SWIFT dossier The conclusions of the reports from both the Belgian privacy committee and the European Committee are clear and unanimous the Belgian and European rules on data protection have clearly been flouted In view of the fact that the Belgian courts have now decided not to prosecute SWIFT and the Belgian Government cannot see any point in continuing those illegal practices I should like to ask what Europes response to this is Will the Commission now start an infringement procedure against Belgium If so when will this be decided If not what does the Commission intend to do to ensure that the European privacy rules are respected hic et nunc in all Member States including Belgium P Finally at the Council of 15 December the SWIFT case was also raised by the Belgian Prime Minister who argued in favour of a European approach Although I understand from the presidency that the inquiry is still underway I have a very straightforward question are the Council and hence all the Member States behind the idea of regulating this issue by means of a European instrument Mr President I do not doubt Commissioner Frattinis own personal good faith and commitment to data protection But I think the Commission as well as the Council are being as feeble about SWIFT privacy abuses as they have been over PNR over the last four years This is European data belonging to European citizens made available for commercial purposes in Europe under the protection of European data protection law But despite the persistent and insistent demands of MEPs the EU in the less than robust hands of the Council and Commission has allowed a large degree of US extraterritorial jurisdiction In any global framework for exchange of mass commercial data for security purposes the EU must forcefully project its own laws and principles P Commissioner you say that it is unlikely that SWIFT data have been used in the automated targeting system which is a profiling exercise assigning a risk score to each individual based on assumptions and no doubt stereotypes deriving from their behaviour and characteristics But why do you not know categorically yes or no whether SWIFT data has been used in ATS In relation to PNR you accept the Department of Homeland Securitys assurance that the use of PNR data for profiling complies with the undertakings of the PNR agreement But do you agree with the DHS assessment Yes or no The lack of clear answers is undermining trust and I think that we are owed those clear answers as to the Commissions legal evaluation NL Mr President Commissioner Frattini you did not beat about the bush when you made your commitment to the negotiations known Full compliance with the fundamental rights including privacy there is no room for any misunderstanding here and we will keep you to this pledge There is then little point in 780 MEPs sitting where the negotiators should be it would not work That does however mean that the Council must be ambitious in its negotiations instead of as I now hear them doing mainly weighing up the hazards it might meet with along the way We assume however that your commitment to the negotiations is as firm as Commissioner Frattinis because we will hold you to that as well P This is about SWIFT now and SWIFT not being a bank should not be a licence not to take privacy rules seriously or not to comply with them The inquiry you mounted Commissioner Frattini is to be welcomed but you will need to take legal measures promptly in order to fill the vacuum because data exchange at SWIFT should also be able to stand the test of European privacy rules P The fight against terror must also be able to look into financial transactions in this framework because this may well lead to terrorist organisations Something that has struck me is that many citizens have much sympathy for the difficult dilemmas we face in this context We cannot resolve this overnight I am for example quite shocked by the fact that there has not been more of a fuss made about the rules on liquids in aircraft We should not seize this as an excuse though Tough negotiations are needed The suggestion mooted by Mr Radwan to place this in a wider G7 context is something I am happy to endorse DE Mr President Mr PresidentinOffice of the Council Mr President of the Commission none us in this House disputes the fact that there needs to be enhanced prevention of terrorism in the future However the issue inevitably arises of the means to be used in this connection as well as the issue of the strategies to be adopted Undoubtedly international cooperation and the exchange of data are just as much a part of the process as on the other hand legal certainty and the necessary data protection As all of us do in this House I support transatlantic cooperation in this connection P We must however attach importance to seeing a balance maintained between security and the combating of terrorism on the one hand and data protection on the other If moreover it is now a question of negotiating a new agreement then this new agreement needs to fulfil certain basic preconditions P Firstly personal data needs to be given the same level of protection as has already been achieved in the interim agreement Secondly the airlines must be afforded legal certainty so that the promise to switch over to a push system enabling us to control which data is delivered to whom and at which juncture is kept The purpose for which the data can be used must also of course be laid down so that the data can only and is only allowed to be used for the purpose of preventing and combating terrorism There should also in future be a duty to provide travellers with information in this connection P I would make one last point which I do think is important In negotiating the new agreement added value should also be created As soon as an act of terrorism is suspected the US authorities should be obliged to notify the corresponding judicial and police authorities in the Member States as well as the corresponding EU institutions namely Europol or Eurojust If all this is guaranteed we shall have available to us a further instrument designed to make EU citizens more secure Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should firstly like to thank you most sincerely for the many comments ideas and of course whether one likes them or not the critical remarks In a debate they serve to indicate whether or not one is on the right track and whether it is possible to prevent some state of affairs that was not perhaps right in the past from arising again P Not only legal protection and legal certainty but also the issue of how we are to combat specific forms of international terrorism are it is true unanimously deemed to be important but we must not in any circumstances play these off against each other Where the two areas of PNR and SWIFT are concerned we face different situations P In the statement by the Presidency I again made a point of clearly emphasising cooperation and interchange with the Commission on the basis of which we wish together to arrive at a legally certain regulation This raises many issues to which you have also referred today including those of how extensive the information is what access there is to it and what controls need to be exercised by the other party Similar issues arise too where the subject of SWIFT is concerned and in this connection I am again happy to take up Mr Radwans idea Irrespective of whether or not it is at present on the agendas of the G7 or G8 or comes within the area of relations between the European Union and the United States it is important to address this issue P There would certainly be no benefit in just moving constantly from one aspect to the next as what is at issue here is essentially the same We are concerned with data protection with legal certainty and furthermore with the form to be taken by the transatlantic partnership in connection with which we are of the view that partnership is not a oneway street It is a question of working with rather than against each other P We need the information concerned and relations between the European Union and the United States should be such that in the forthcoming meetings between the two countries it should be possible to address the issues very clearly above all with a view to confronting the danger that some of you have described I can do no more than say how absolutely right it is to address these issues openly When are we to be confronted with the next case in which data is perhaps unsafely accessed That is a point that we should like to take up Without now going into technical details I also say that with specifically SWIFT in mind Where is the data Is it here and would we have the opportunity to put it in order and limit its extent without its being passed on Or is the data possibly already available in the USA where because of the nature of data protection there it is very easy to access The implication in that case however is that we have no influence at all P The question is however that of what influence the European Union has on data that is transferred and that is as it were ready to be called up elsewhere Specifically where SWIFT is concerned this is certainly a complicated procedure All this should however give us the opportunity for discussing these matters in depth and for arguing how important it is for us in the European Union to stand for certain values and also to act in defence of those values It should also give us the opportunity for arguing how essential it is to maintain the existing balance That does not mean that we are always in agreement about the fight against international terrorism It is just that all these matters have to be balanced out P Commissioner Frattini did in fact make this very clear in giving precedence not only to peoples safety but also to legal protection and to the very high level of data protection such as we do in fact have in the European Union I can only assure you that these many facets that you have discussed are also to be included for discussion in the forthcoming negotiations and in relation not only to PNR but also of course to SWIFT VicePresident of the Commission IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen as always I shall be perfectly sincere in my reply to this House and I shall also address the points on which I do not share your views P First as the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs is well aware and its chairman Mr Cavada is here I have never under any circumstances either denied or concealed any information including confidential information that I could have given to the committee and thus to Parliament I intend to continue in the same way as I said in my introduction Thus I do not share the opinion which is actually to prejudge the issue that the European institutions and Parliament in particular might be in danger of being excluded from this political process P You are well aware that I am in favour of your being politically involved even when the Treaties do not allow for it I have said it a thousand times and I shall say it again we shall find a way and that is why I welcome Mr Cavadas idea of even organising an agreement with the US Congress to monitor the political stages of these negotiations It is also clear that this debate has affected Euroatlantic relations contrary to what somebody said I am convinced that if Europe wants to be a leader on the world political stage it must achieve a global balance between the right I personally consider it a duty to pursue and investigate terrorists and the duty to protect fundamental rights such as the privacy of personal data P It is therefore obvious that if as the PresidentinOffice of the Council has just said we want to achieve an overall balance together with the United States we want to do so because we are convinced that Euroatlantic relations are crucial not only with regard to Europes past history but above all with regard to its present and future history P As many of you are well aware I have on many occasions supplied detailed answers above all to the Committee on Civil Liberties of course but I address Parliament when I am invited to do so and I speak to those committees that invite me Regarding the push system for instance I announced in December that experiments with such a system for passenger name records would begin before the end of the month and they did The experiment was started with the US Administrations Customs and Border Protection System and Amadeus There is a technical point regarding requests for ad hoc data but it is a technical problem while the push experiment has indeed started as we had been promised P With regard to the number of data items I was interested to hear what many of you had to say about the 34 items that are currently the subject of the PNR agreement I can tell you quite openly that as far as my part in the negotiations is concerned I intend to call for the number of data items in question to be cut but not because I subscribe to the idea that the US is asking for too many If all 34 items were of use in pursuing terrorists I would not be afraid to tell you that 34 items were needed However the really useful items are probably those 19 that have been mentioned that is to say a much smaller number P Believe me though the principle that counts as regards the data to be processed is not the number of items but rather the usefulness of the data and it is on those grounds that I intend to take action in the negotiations I do not mean to endorse the idea that if we cut the 34 items down to 15 we will in any case have done a good job we may actually have done a very bad job if some of the excluded data items could have prevented a terrorist attack I am in no doubt about one thing I am quite certain that the main aim is to make the system effective Who has access to the data What for How many data and for how long These are the points of an agreement that we are going to start negotiating soon and Parliament will be kept informed as I have already said P Ladies and gentlemen many of you believe that passenger information is the missing factor in the PNR system It is fair to imagine that if no consensus is reached between the two sides no agreement will be made at the end of July Just in my minds eye I can see a very simple solution every ticket to the United States that is purchased could come with a sheet for the passenger to sign informing them that their data will be processed in a particular way If that should happen and I strongly hope that it never will we will certainly have ensured that passengers are given information but without an agreement at European level passengers rights will be limited to the private sphere of the air carriage contract That is an eventuality that we must avert by every possible means which is why we must try to achieve a new European agreement The alternative would be very simple passengers would merely need to be asked to accept a few restrictions as part of the air carriage contract and I believe that the majority who want to go to the United States for honest reasons would sign it We would however be giving up a role for Europe that we have already played and which it is vital that we still play That is why we need new negotiations in part to cut down the number of data items but in such a way that reducing the amount of data does not jeopardise the fight against terrorism P In connection with the ATS system I have mentioned to the Committee on Civil Liberties that I have received written assurances from the United States regarding compliance with the PNR agreement In a speech made in this Chamber I was criticised for not having checked the veracity of this statement Ladies and gentlemen if I in Brussels had the power to investigate the behaviour of the United States I would have powers that no authority at either European or national level has ever had or is ever likely to have Everything is possible apart from checking the veracity of that letter as I was asked to do in that speech When I receive a formal reply saying that the rules are being complied with I have to take it at face value unless there is evidence to the contrary That is what happens between allies unless you have some evidence to the contrary which I frankly do not have and I am being absolutely honest because otherwise we would have to open a permanent inquiry into every minute detail of the letters we receive from the United States P Mrs Roure asked me whether we can give Parliament our information on the negotiating mandate As you know such information is classified nonetheless as I said before even though it is classified we will find a way to keep Parliament informed in other words a way to give you political information without violating a rule enshrined in the Treaties whereby classified EU restricted information cannot be published This is the political solution that I propose if the Treaty is amended so as to specify a mechanism by which classified acts may be communicated to Parliament I shall apply such a rule without hesitation It is a matter however of overcoming the obstacle that Parliament cannot be informed if classified material is involved I shall keep you up to date on this P Many people have called for a framework agreement Mr President which I think is the right way to go A framework agreement on data transmission is precisely what we have started working on with the Presidency we are setting up a joint working party to deal with a number of topics relating to personal data processing separate therefore from the SWIFT case and PNR which are going on in parallel We believe that the time has now come to conclude a Euroatlantic political agreement a framework agreement with the United States on personal data processing and we intend to work on this agreement in order to specify what kinds of data can be transmitted for what purposes and for how long P Ladies and gentlemen there is a further point that has not been addressed in this debate but which needs to be addressed how can we preserve the confidentiality of the technical information that forms part of this agreement Since it concerns investigation procedures it would be a gift to criminals if it were revealed Such information needs to be kept confidential There is thus another problem because it is obvious that we would be giving suspected terrorists a powerful tool if we revealed details about how they are monitored Can a solution be found I am quite sure that one can but there needs to be political will on both sides P I should like to end with a final thought none of all that justifies the specific violations of European law and the legislative failings in the SWIFT case You may recall that when nobody was yet talking about a European agreement I addressed the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs on the need for such an agreement because it is much better to close a legislative gap with a European rule than to leave it to the individual Member States to legislate as they please The SWIFT case is typical out of 27 Member States only seven have given me a reply That is a sign that the issue needs to be addressed at a European level P For all these reasons therefore I can assure you that 1 I believe that a political agreement is essential and that the legitimacy of such an agreement will be weaker if Parliament is not involved and 2 such a political agreement should be aimed at solving the problems constructively without pointing the finger at the United States as if it was the problem the problem ladies and gentlemen is the terrorists not the United States The debate is closed The vote will take place during the next partsession P Since it is time to resume the sitting there will be no suspension P I would like to thank the interpreters for their generosity and professionalism this Parliament could not function without them P Written statements Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure PT There have been months and months of condemnation of the unacceptable transfer of passenger name records by airlines and of personal data by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications SWIFT system to the security and information services of the United States Yet in response to the questions asked here in Parliament the German Presidency of the Council and the Commission have offered nothing that would result in complete clarification of these matters and an end to this blatant violation of the citizens rights freedoms and guarantees P Their responses do not contain a single word on the practical measures needed to put an end to these unacceptable illegal practices or on demanding full clarification from the US Administration P Such behaviour is ultimately indicative of the Councils submissive passive attitude to the USAs blackmail and demands P I must also mention the attempts by those whose only goal is to benefit from these situations by further applying qualified majority voting in the Council on issues of justice and home affairs All measures that under the guise of the socalled war on terror undermine the citizens fundamental rights must be rejected outright EL Both the Commission and the Council have confirmed in their statements that they will continue to satisfy US demands by holding files on all European citizens and handing over their personal data to the US secret security services P The representatives of the German Presidency and the Commission have not only accepted that the new agreement with the USA on the transmission of the personal data of passengers flying there will not differ from the present agreement they have also cynically admitted that they are prepared to legalise the SWIFT scandal by laying down socalled principles for the provision of information on financial transactions by European citizens in the USA so that this will now be legal P As they clearly stated they will not commit the cardinal sin of disrupting relations between the EU and the USA As far as the protection of fundamental rights personal data and privacy are concerned they will try to persuade our American friends to respect them obviously just as they respect them in Iraq and Afghanistan P It is crystal clear that the policies of the EU and the USA are identical are equally reactionary and antidemocratic and are equally dangerous to democratic rights and grassroots freedoms using as they do the fight against terrorism as the necessary pretext to limit fundamental rights",

    "input": "Further convergence in supervisory practices at EU level debate The next item is the debate on P the oral question by Pervenche Berès on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the Council on further convergence in supervisory practices at EU level B600102007 and P the oral question by Pervenche Berès on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the Commission on further convergence in supervisory practices at EU level B604492006 author FR Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thought it necessary that there should be a debate on supervision among the European institutions and we wanted to be able to have one in the presence of the Council and of the Commission We members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs are very pleased about the relaunch of discussions and work within the Council and the Commission alike on the management of the crisis on the financial markets More effective and better supervision and cooperation among supervisors is a matter of necessity but nevertheless if we want the ultimate result to be success we do think that at this stage of the development and profound transformation of financial markets the opening of an interinstitutional debate on this subject is without doubt the best way of making headway P The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done a great deal of work on the analysis of the European financial system and the implications of consolidation in financial services not least in Mr Muscats report in which we express our support for the establishment of a Committee of Wise Men mandated not only to examine the implications of the consolidation of markets and of financial institutions together with the implications of financial supervision financial stability and crisis management but also to come up with definite ideas about the existing structures and incorporate them in a report to this House P The object of todays interinstitutional debate is to give a clear signal as to the need for the opening or reopening of the great debate on the future of Europes supervisory systems which is essential in the interests not only of the competitiveness of the financial market itself but also of the stability of the European Unions financial system P Perhaps I might at this juncture be permitted to make certain observations First let me say that there have been profound changes in the financial system in Europe and around the world Day in and day out we are witnesses to incessant changes in the markets and to the innovations produced in those markets developments that result inter alia in the gain of greater power by hedge funds or private equities The ongoing consolidation of financial markets has made it possible for key actors to establish themselves and to act on completely transnational bases Mergers and takeovers motivated by the quest for competitiveness and efficiency have grown whether at the national or European level or globally They have come to generate their own impetus and hence the structure of the markets as well as the way in which the actors operate on them have undergone radical changes a transformation producing new challenges with new things at stake P Secondly I would observe that the consolidation of financial supervision structures must go hand in hand with the consolidation of the markets themselves for one sometimes gets the impression that they follow different rhythms This being so one can find oneself wondering whether the present system of supervision in the European Union in which supervisors have specific and very different structures for which they are responsible have highly divergent competences powers and responsibilities and act on the basis of a national mandate is capable of ensuring the proper supervision of large multinational financial groups One wonders whether the system is sustainable and whether it might perhaps jeopardise the financial stability of the European system itself P Thirdly I would highlight the peculiarities of the European Unions financial system which is characterised by diversity and by the wealth of operators be they local local banks for example or actors operating across frontiers on both sides of the Atlantic and on the global stage That calls for a solid efficient and welladapted supervisory framework capable of responding to the challenges of regional integration of globalisation of innovation and of centralised management while at the same time providing a high standard of supervision and ensuring that the system is sound and stable P Fourthly I would point out that improvement of the supervisory systems is in the interests of all the players primarily of course in the interests of the system itself but secondly also in the interests of the participants in the market who are asking us to improve the supervision system in order to facilitate their operations on all markets I am persuaded that the end user will also have an interest in the improvement of the system P Fifthly and finally the issue of European excellence in regulatory matters does have a transatlantic dimension and it is with that in mind that it appears to me that the time has come for us to move forward P I will sum up by saying that in view of these observations we as Europes lawmakers face a major challenge that of endowing Europe with solid and efficient prudential structures capable of ensuring the proper supervision of all financial actors be they large multinational groups or highstreet banks and capable also of making supervision contribute to the competitiveness of the European model on the world stage P The question therefore arises as to how to go about doing this are we to set up a committee of wise men or are we to consider that it is on an interinstitutional basis that we might perhaps be better placed to put the collective European intelligence to work That in any case is the message that this House wants to convey in this debate today and I am very grateful to the Council and the Commission for allowing the debate to be held in Parliament PresidentinOffice of the Council DE Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen Mrs Berès has just raised a number of important issues in her speech including with regard to financial services I can assure her that the Council considers this aspect to be of key importance P I should like to underline once again that the European financial system is also regarded as making an important contribution to the Lisbon Strategy and plays a pivotal role in strengthening the financialstability framework in the EU What is equally important however is that the efficiency of financial supervision be enhanced without encumbering the financial sector with an excessive supervisory burden or restricting competition Allow me to draw attention to three key points in the Council conclusions mentioned P Firstly the Council stressed the importance of fair and nondiscriminatory national supervisory practices to achieve a level playing field within the EU It also attached importance to striking the appropriate balance of homehost country responsibilities and emphasised once more the importance of an adequate and independent financial supervision to ensure financial stability P Secondly the Council invited the three level 3 committees to take into account the obstacles identified in the course of their work and in their reports and also the report by the Financial Services Committee FSC on supervisory convergence in their endeavours towards convergence of rules and practices It is particularly important in this regard that they work on common formats for financial institutions reporting to supervisors in order to avoid duplication of costs P Thirdly the Council declared its support for the Commissions intention to use its powers to also ensure compliance with the rules on competition and state aid The Council considers it a priority to support the work of the three level 3 committees for which they need suitable supervisory tools The Council conclusions of May 2006 also contain a comprehensive short and mediumterm action plan for this field based on a report by the Financial Services Committee The thoroughly revised supervisory rules for insurance and securities firms and banks constitute a milestone providing a new basis for cooperation between supervisors to the benefit of the financial stability and competitiveness of our financial industry P The FSC report indicated three challenges revealing the need for further action I believe that these challenges will be particularly significant in the immediate future Firstly supervisory convergence and cooperation must be further strengthened Secondly the efficiency of the supervisory regime must be increased and thirdly international supervision must be improved in view of the growing number of crossborder financial groups P In the light of these challenges the action plan approved by the Council in May of last year comprises a combination of several tools These are aimed at fostering the creation of a European supervisory culture a mediation and delegation mechanism and also electronic datasharing arrangements and common formats for reporting I note that this last aspect has been emphasised also at European Parliament level in the Muscat report I welcome the convergence of views on this too P The Financial Services Committee has been asked to monitor the progress achieved by the three level 3 committees in implementing the various tools in particular P The FSC has also been instructed to monitor the convergence of supervisory powers at an adequate level I know that the Commission is also devoting considerable attention to these aspects and am confident that Parliament too will support this process within the framework of its dialogue with the level 3 committees Further insights are expected as a result of the work of the Interinstitutional Monitoring Group P I should now like to move on to the longterm prospects and the matter of tackling regulatory issues Besides the existing challenges that have already been mentioned the FSC must take into account issues arising from market developments when establishing longterm strategic priorities In this regard the FSC recently set up a new subgroup which is due to present a report on longterm supervisory issues by autumn 2007 This new strand of work will be based on the following bottomup approach further fundamental changes in supervisory tasks should be made only where there is proof of problems P I should also like to emphasise that the overall issue of supervisory convergence must be seen in the context of the consolidation of markets and financial institutions For this reason I am particularly pleased that Parliament and the Council managed to agree in the first instance on the text of the Directive on the supervisory assessment of acquisitions in the financial sector as early as March This is a clear indication of our common determination to improve the EU framework for the daytoday work of our supervisory authorities P Finally I should like to emphasise that we must take account of all the challenges of this kind facing the EU bodies in the fields specified These include strengthening financial stability by means of supervisory arrangements and procedures and also fostering European competitiveness both of which benefit from facilitating the consolidation of our financial industry The process of doing so must also be conducive to the protection of consumer interests The Council is working together with the Commission on all the aspects specified and we also welcome the strong interest of the European Parliament which is also demonstrated by this debate I should like to express my particular thanks for Parliaments commitment to promote further progress Member of the Commission Mr President honourable Members the European financial sector has changed dramatically over the last few years Capital markets have expanded and are increasingly integrated New investment techniques have emerged The consolidation of the banking sector has accelerated PanEuropean conglomerates now play a major role on all national markets P These changes are positive for the efficiency of our financial industry and should be welcomed But they also present new challenges to policymakers We must ensure that our arrangements for financial supervision are adapted to the needs of a more integrated EU financial sector This is vital for financial stability and for the competitiveness of our industry P Greater cooperation and convergence between European supervisors is of utmost importance in this context It has been one of my priorities since I joined the Commission and will remain so until the end of my mandate P Let me briefly recall what the Commission has already done to foster a more effective and efficient supervisory system in Europe P Under the Lamfalussy process it has created European committees of supervisors in the areas of securities banking and insurance These committees have already led to greater supervisory cooperation and more convergence in supervisory practices I expect them to continue and accelerate work in this regard It is crucial for achieving coordination in crisis situations P The Commission has pushed for more streamlined supervision of large financial institutions in particular through the establishment of the consolidating supervisor concept in the capital requirements directives The consolidating supervisor is responsible for ensuring proper information exchange between supervisors central banks and finance ministries in the event of a crisis His role is key and I therefore intend to propose further and more ambitious steps towards consolidating supervision in the area of insurance in the framework of the Solvency II project P In investment services we have the principle of more central control with some limited exceptions for branches P In order to deal more specifically with financial stability issues my departments have set work in motion on five interconnected areas on which clarity is required if we want to improve our ability to respond to financial crisis These are liquidity arrangements crisis management lenderoflastresort issues deposit guarantee schemes and the windingup of financial institutions There will be a Commission conference on these matters on 26 June in which Mrs Berès as Chairwoman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will also take part P The Commissions efforts have to be seen in conjunction with the work undertaken in the Ecofin Council A crisissimulation exercise took place in 2006 As a followup to that exercise the Council will reflect in 2007 on how better to address crossborder crisis situations and clarify burdensharing arrangements In addition the Financial Services Committee has initiated work on issues related to improvement of supervisory efficiency P The Interinstitutional Monitoring Committee on the Lamfalussy process will also complete its final report in 2007 I hope it will contain useful recommendations as to how the committees of supervisors can improve their work and deepen their cooperation This would place them in an even better position to address possible financial stability issues in the future P Towards the end of this year the Commission will also produce its own assessment of the way in which the Lamfalussy process works Clearly the functioning of the committees of supervisors will be a crucial aspect of this overall assessment I look forward to hearing Parliaments views P I am convinced that through close cooperation between Parliament the Council and the Commission we can move this debate forward Conclusions will need to be drawn from the various ongoing activities I am open to suggestions on how to go about this I think however that it would be too early to create a committee of wise persons at this stage I would rather await the completion of the different initiatives later this year before envisaging the next move P Let me conclude EU financial markets are strong We do not have a broken supervisory system in need of repair Major progress has been made over the last few years in terms of modernising EU supervisory arrangements but further improvements are also necessary They are the consequence of integration On this we are all agreed We should continue our efforts to make the Lamfalussy structure the regulatory vehicle for delivering the effective efficient and converged supervision required by a single market in financial services Work has been set in motion in order to determine how the Lamfalussy structure and our financial stability arrangements can be further improved to meet the demands that arise from closer European integration P I look forward to discussing with Parliament in due course what precise initiatives may be required to respond to the problems that have been identified so as to equip our European financial sector with the best possible supervisory system This is critical because topclass supervisory and regulatory structures are crucial for longterm EU capital market competitors in the global economy on behalf of the PPEDE Group DE Madam President it is good that Mrs Berès question on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is being discussed and answered here today This follows on seamlessly from the Muscat report and also from yesterdays debate in committee in which the Commissioner also participated P The crisis simulation with a view to reviewing financial stability in the EU that was presented at the Ecofin meeting in Helsinki last September has indeed revealed shortcomings This scenario that is constantly evolving financial instruments such as hedge funds and derivative financial instruments illustrates the need for further debate that takes sufficient account of consumer security Thus we need a system of functional interlinked supervisory rules and practices in the EU P Consumer protection an effective financial industry and stable financial markets constitute the supreme objective of financial supervision which must also help the industry fully utilise its potential and creativity Therefore good supervision must be guided by the existing risks and must take a principlebased approach instead of devoting itself to detailed individual analysis It must not impose any additional burdens on enterprises the rules must be developed in close contact with the financial industry and crossborder financial markets must be dealt with at panEuropean and global level in equal measure P Supervision should be limited to what is really necessary and useful Existing measures should be used in a more cautious more marketfriendly way avoiding imposing unnecessary burdens At the present time I strongly oppose a centralised European supervisory authority additional and parallel to the national supervisory authorities as this would cancel out the EU principle of subsidiarity and lack any democratic legitimacy Not only would a body such as this meet with a lack of understanding on the part of many particularly as it would create additional nontransparent bureaucracy but it would also be accompanied by a serious loss of sovereignty for the Member States as it would disregard national budgets in the case of crises P Let us first wait and see how the supervisory bodies of the newly formed 27 come together and do their work We do not need a uniform centralised supervisory structure but we do need a common supervisory culture characterised by the same values and objectives on behalf of the PSE Group MT There has been constant reference to a report drawn up by myself dealing with this area in detail and approved by this Parliament P This report which has now been adopted as the position of this Parliament contains an analysis of a situation that is becoming ever more acute One of the most important points is the fact that different practices and levels of supervision exist at national level From a European perspective this signifies a reduction in market efficiency as well as further operating costs for institutions that operate in different countries The report questions whether the present system ensures the effective supervision of large groups that operate in various countries and sectors We even requested a more detailed examination of the European Social Model at the level of prudential stability and crisis management structures We agreed on the need for an effective crisis management system at European level The current market development trend means that a crisis even if initially originating in one country can quickly spread to other countries P The reaction to a crisis such as this one is becoming increasingly complex because of the large number of institutions involved and the lack of clarity about what their role consists of European consumers and investors are ultimately those who suffer the most from lack of action in this sector Within this framework Parliament agreed on the need for a committee of experts to study these implications and report back with their recommendations P I am well aware that there are different opinions on this initiative and on the form it ought to take However I believe that the time has come for a full debate on the matter with all the institutions participating What we do not need is for everyone to try to leave each other out of the debate when it comes to deciding what shape the supervision of European financial markets will take I believe we must focus our efforts more on the urgent need to debate this point and stress that we have no time to lose on behalf of the ALDE Group LT I would like to say that perhaps most countries have a saying about starting preparations for winter during the summer As we discuss this issue we would like to remind the European Commission and Council of that old truism Because up to now we were always told that working groups would be formed and this question would be discussed Without a doubt consolidation has its positive aspects however with it comes an increased systematic risk in the market Financial groups operate in all European Union countries and quite often dependence on their activity and the influence of their activity is quite high When we talk about reforming supervisory processes we must first ask ourselves something that I usually ask the heads of European supervisory bodies if a subsidiary firm is operating in a certain country and because of its unsatisfactory operation that countrys economy is starting to suffer who will pay Who will be responsible Which countrys legislation will apply Another question If a crisis situation develops in the subsidiary firm how will it be managed At the national level or the financial groups level Unfortunately as yet we have no answer to these simple questions I am quite pleased with the information that Council and Commission representatives supplied for us in relation to what is being done however once again I would like to stress that as new risky products find their way onto the market we must speed up all processes and get together to resolve the basic issues and not to get lost in details because talking about various types of coordination and suchlike is all very well until a crisis develops The reference point for our decisions about reforming supervisory processes has to be what we would do in a crisis situation Madam President I would like to thank the Chairwoman of our committee Mrs Berès for her timely contribution We started discussing the van den Burg report in committee this week and one of the key topics also in the postFSAP agenda is how to develop a good supervisory system for Europe It is very important for us to hear what the Council and Commission think about the future in this joint agenda P The Financial Services Action Plan is now more or less complete so the focus is now on implementation and supervisory convergence We think that even though national regulators have already been able to develop quite good practices the work must go on and beyond the Lamfalussy committees It is for example very positive that we now have colleges of supervisors handling big multijurisdiction panEuropean cases but sometimes these colleges lack authority they do not have enough resources they do not take enough majority decisions for example so it would be very good if we could consider more qualified majority voting in Level 3 committees as well as in the colleges of supervisors P I would also like to point out that in Mrs van den Burgs draft report we have promoted a new idea that for top panEuropean players we should have a wellequipped European supervisory authority inside the system We would like to create a European supervisory authority but it should not be outside the scope of the Commissions current sphere of responsibility It should be inside the system I think this idea could also be considered by the Commission P Finally it is also important to develop cooperation at global level We know that the financial risks and prudential challenges are not only European but also very much involve the big market players in America and so on so it is very good that the Commission has taken this financial services dialogue with transatlantic partners seriously but there needs to be continual further development Member of the Commission Mr President I would like to thank all the Members for their very valuable contributions P As I said earlier the development of financial supervision is of critical importance A stable financial environment is a prerequisite for the economic growth that the EU needs and the protection of consumers So the prevention of financial crises is important Supervision needs to be as efficient and effective as possible We need to make practices of national supervisory authorities

procedure Sections II IV V VI VII VIII and IX P and on the European Parliaments preliminary draft estimates Section I for the 2008 budget procedure P Section I European Parliament P Section II Council P Section IV Court of Justice P Section V Court of Auditors P Section VI Economic and Social Committee P Section VII Committee of the Regions P Section VIIIA European Ombudsman P Section IX European Data Protection Supervisor P rapporteur FI Mr President the main idea behind the budget for 2008 is that we can ensure that 2008 is the year of the taxpayers which in practice means keeping expenditure more or less at 2007 levels The level of inflation needs to be raised to 2007 levels It nevertheless needs to be pointed out that this cannot apply to buildings Buildings policy has to be kept separate because we now have so many commitments regarding buildings that expenditure in this area is bound to increase beyond this level but then that is how the matters has been presented out in this proposal and report It is also however important for Parliaments reputation that we look after the taxpayers money and do not necessarily implement all the wonderful projects which have been proposed The people cannot have confidence in Parliament if each year we spend money in accordance with the 20 rule although now in 2008 when there will be no further enlargement or any new languages we have a real chance of adhering to 2007 levels and showing the taxpayers that we are genuinely concerned about how much money is being spent here P There need to be a few more projects With respect to information policy we have to send a clear message to the people about what happens here and this may be best realised through visitors groups which has been a priority for many years That is surely the best sort of information policy although another issue is the smallscale local media which does not have the resources to pay for trips to Parliament The local media should be able to visit Parliament more often and we need to find some solution where we MEPs could invite more representatives of the local media here because this is just the sort of media which people read and listen to and if it reports positively on us Parliaments reputation and that of the EU as a whole is bound to improve P We also need to pay more attention to the way we draft legislation and this means that we must have good and sufficient technical facilities In this connection there is a proposal that for example we Members should be able to connect to computers via our mobile phones That facility exists in almost all the national parliaments but not in the EUs Parliament and these things need to be put right by the year 2008 P Translation services are a subject we talk about daily and this of course is largely about how equally all Members are treated regardless of which language area they come from and this is something that is certainly in need of major and above all structural change These services however always need to be kept functional P I would furthermore emphasise that we could keep at this current level and with regard to buildings although some claim that 2008 is the last year in which money can be used for them the list is very long indeed We have talked about external offices in London Stockholm and Paris We are embarking on the KAD construction project in Luxembourg at the same time as another institution the European Court of Auditors starts on a major construction project there Here in Brussels we have completion work to do on new buildings we have the purchase of premises close to here in the banana building there is the completion of the Sports Centre The list could go on but this only goes to show that not all of them can be embarked on or realised in 2008 instead a priority list should be drawn up for buildings and we need then to proceed with reference to it P I believe that the preparatory work has been done in the right spirit and that we all wish to tell the taxpayer that the year 2008 has been specifically proclaimed the year of the taxpayers on behalf of the PPEDE Group LV Mr President ladies and gentlemen first of all on behalf of the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats I would like to express my support for the rapporteurs approach that the European Parliaments level of expenditure should be based on requirements that are justified following careful evaluation In this speech however I would like to draw attention to my proposal to reduce consumption of paper and energy resources at the European Parliament The EU institutions ought to set an example of environmentally friendly policies and reduce consumption of energy resources Unfortunately in various spheres the European Parliament uses resources inappropriately for example by consuming paper extravagantly and using unnecessary intensive airconditioning in the summer Reducing paper consumption and using airconditioning more rationally would produce both gains from the environmental viewpoint and also significant savings in the European Parliaments budget In practice all European Parliament documents are accessible in electronic form My proposal envisages reducing the circulation of paper versions of documents by stipulating that paper versions of many documents would be available on request instead of being automatically distributed to all Members and officials Every working day the Members and Parliament officials receive an enormous quantity of paper documents The majority of these are subsequently thrown away since should it be necessary electronic versions of the document are available It would be much more rational to allow the Members and Parliament officials to stipulate which documents they wish to receive in future in paper form and which they will read electronically The potential saving is considerable in view of the fact that the European Parliaments current consumption of paper is nearly 850 tonnes a year or 34 million sheets a week With regard to airconditioning the proposal envisages raising the air temperature of the European Parliament by a few degrees in summer Up until now it has been kept unnecessarily and even uncomfortably low Thank you for your attention on behalf of the PSE Group SK The fathers of the idea of a united Europe did not know what would happen 50 years on but there is one thing they knew for certain if we are to build Europe we must build it together We have transposed these words of Robert Schuman in a striking way into the EU slogan and logo which reads Together P In the 2008 budget we emphasise the political importance of the instruments we would like to use to better inform European citizens One of our aims is to eliminate the shortcomings that undermine the European Unions image especially with a view to the 2009 elections Ladies and gentlemen on Saturday many of you along with millions of TV viewers were watching the major concert held in Brussels to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome However the overall impression was not so much a commemoration but rather an embarrassment The entire event would have achieved a far greater symbolism if artists from all of the Member States had been invited P If we want to deal with problems successfully we need to take a comprehensive view It will not suffice for us as the European Parliament to make progress in communication and information policies We need to work with the Commission and the European Houses in the Member States to elaborate effective communication measures and then to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the process Our emphasis on a comprehensive approach and strengthened cooperation between institutions will result in greater transparency and a more efficient use of resources P Ladies and gentlemen Parliament recently decided to adopt a meaningful statute on the assistants employed by MEPs I would therefore ask you to adopt an amendment calling on the Council to take a definitive decision in the matter As we all know this statute will ultimately contribute to improving the quality of our work on behalf of the ALDE Group DA Mr President I would thank Mr Itälä for his constructive work on the report on Parliaments 2008 budget He proposes that next years expenditure remain in principle at the 2007 level and that is something that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe can happily endorse in principle Following enlargement 2008 is of course a year of consolidation and very good cases will have to be made out for meeting additional needs if meeting them would have budgetary consequences At the same time we would concur with the observation that 2008 will probably be the last year in which we can use the surplus of up to 20 in the EUs administrative expenditure for the purchase of buildings Last but not least I want to emphasise what Mr Maňka also said namely that now we are obtaining a Members Statute this needs to be backed up by a Statute of Members assistants here in Parliament On this point we do not have the Councils support and without that support we cannot put matters in order Let us get something done about that on behalf of the GUENGL Group FI Mr President the European Parliaments expenditure has grown very rapidly This growth can be explained by the enlargement of the Union and the ensuing need for interpretation and translation services as well as space It has been estimated that 60 of costs are due to the demand for multilingualism and a policy of having several places of business P So far all the expenditure has been financed out of the 20 of the Unions administrative costs whose use was agreed on unofficially with the other budgetary authority the Council Within the context of Parliaments expenditure 2008 is a sort of gap year Funding for new premises is in order and there is no new round of enlargement in sight Consequently the rapporteurs view that Parliament should not invent new artificial expenditure for itself and should not necessarily aim at the 20 level is right If we do that there is a danger that Parliaments big groups will fund their own political objectives out of common administrative expenditure and that will be a financial burden for Parliament after 2008 Mr President I agree with the rapporteur that the institutions should base their estimates on welldefined needs This should result in better efficiency of resources thus avoiding duplication of functions In this respect we expect the final proposal for an interinstitutional agreement for the two committees the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee to be reached in 2007 ensuring equitable governance of the joint departments P Prima facie it seems reasonable to request that Parliament should retain the same budgeting level as in 2007 However we should ensure that Parliaments financial independence is not compromised in any way especially as the Members Statute amounting to over EUR 100 million comes into force in 2009 P The benchmark of 20 of heading five should be retained as the budgets upper limit This threshold should provide us with the necessary stability and discipline when formulating the 2008 budget P Finally I wish to express my appreciation to Mr Itälä for his report FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen this report is essential not only because it highlights the financial resources used to run the European institutions but also because it underlines Parliaments role as controller and because it gives concrete expression to the functioning of our Europe As the report highlights we need to stabilise our finances and our budgetary strategy for 2008 must be prudent To achieve this priority must be given to among other things improving the performance of our services and the redeployment of staff P I shall make three remarks quickly Firstly while paying tribute to the very high quality of the translation services I should like to highlight the ever more frequent delays in distributing language versions something that has a negative impact on our upstream work P Secondly I should like to reiterate my request to have equivalent technical and information technology resources in the different places of work Strasbourg and Brussels In this period of commemorating the Treaty of Rome I should also like to emphasise the possibility for Parliament to have an ambitious communication plan concerning the media I would also emphasise the need to improve the information given to the citizens for example by doing more to accommodate them during the partsessions Visits by our fellow citizens are often an effective way for them to discover Europe I would therefore like the capacity for receiving visitors to be improved especially in Strasbourg at the seat of the European Parliament The debate is closed P The vote will take place tomorrow at 1100 am P Written Statements Rule 142 in writing Last week the Commission held an important and interesting conference on the ecological taxation ecotaxes Sustainable development and a proper climate policy need political and administrative rules strict regulations directives laws and bylaws But living in a market economy we have to understand the importance of the financial tools as well An adequate tax system can decrease the use of the natural resources pollution and environmental damages and can encourage the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency As Commissioner László Kovács said during the second half of his term he intends to concentrate on taxation promoting the EUs energy targets and to fight climate change The European Parliament should call for a solid and environmentally aware Europeanlevel taxation which can contribute to sustainable development and saving energy",

group Mr Geremek is to have his mandate as a Member of the European Parliament revoked by his own government with effect from 19 April The powers under which the Polish Government is revoking Mr Geremeks mandate are a lustration or monitoring law adopted just a couple of months ago which is currently under legal challenge in Polands constitutional court This law requires all journalists academics and elected MPs to sign a declaration stating that they never collaborated with the Communistera security services P Mr Geremek has signed such declarations in the past His refusal to sign in this case is on moral rather than political grounds He rightly objects to the witchhunt which the Polish Government seeks P Loud and sustained applause P I would ask three things Mr President I would ask first of all whether Mr Kaczyński who met Mr Pöttering last week raised this issue with him secondly whether it is right and indeed possible for a Member of this House to be stripped of their democraticallyelected mandate in this way and thirdly whether you would give this House the assurance that Parliament will act to protect Mr Geremeks right to exercise his democraticallyelected mandate with all possible haste P Loud and sustained applause Mr Watson has in my opinion already broadly expressed a feeling that is shared by us all Chairman of the PSE Group DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen further to what Mr Watson has just said I want to say on behalf of my group and addressing Mr Geremek personally that we as you Mr Geremek will be aware share but few of your political views but there is one point on which you can count on the Socialist Group in this House on its unconditional solidarity and I do believe on that of the House as a whole and that is when it comes to fighting off a government that while being within the European Union seeks to persecute a man who fought as few others have done for Polands liberation and for its development as a democracy It is a disgrace that so great a country should be ruled by such a government P Sustained applause P Mr Watson has said what needed to be said and I expect the President of this House tomorrow to tell the Kaczyński Government that we expect the Polish Government to afford Mr Geremek the protection due to him as a Member of this House We will in future judge everything that has to do with Poland by its treatment of him and I expect Mr Poettering tomorrow to make that as plain as I have P Applause Mr President ladies and gentlemen not only do we agree with Mr Geremek but for years we have fought against Stalinism with Mr Geremek and it is unthinkable that today P Commotion P and that is why this Parliament has to be uncompromising P As the commotion did not stop the Member addressed the President P Can you tell these madmen to keep quiet Ladies and gentlemen Mr CohnBendit has the floor and your behaviour in this matter does little for Parliaments reputation There is only one position that this Parliament can adopt if a government is employing Stalinist or fascist methods we must unhesitatingly protect our fellow Member from all the madmen in this House We stand united P Applause chairman of the GUENGL Group FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen I have been at odds politically with Mr Geremek in the past and will be again in the future Despite that I am only too happy to express to him my deep respect for the political courage that he has demonstrated and on behalf of my group I give him my full support P Applause The chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs Mr Gargani has the floor P Protests Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen as Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs I should like to reassure Parliament and all my fellow Members that as soon as this issue is examined which I hope will be soon P interruption P as soon as the Bureau sends the committee the documentation on this issue we shall duly examine all the documents with the considerable sensitivity for Parliaments autonomy that distinguishes the Legal Committee and we shall once again ensure that this Parliament remains autonomous and that its Members who represent Europe can be protected in their autonomy and freedom Mr President ladies and gentlemen I should like simply to say that every Member here present irrespective of the party to which he or she belongs enjoys parliamentary immunity We are a parliament and we abide by the rules For the time being there has been no request no legal analysis as Mr Gargani has said Mr Geremek has our full support and I can also confirm to him that he has the support of the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats We abide by the rules of law in this House rules that apply to all MEPs including Mr Geremek P Applause The speeches that have been made may well clarify both the form and content of this matter P Ladies and gentlemen we have not received notification today of this decision of the Polish Government which I might add is highly questionable Parliaments role is to safeguard and protect the parliamentary duties exercised by one of its Members P What I imagine will happen is that the Conference of Presidents will have to debate this issue and that the Committee on Legal Affairs precisely in the terms stated by Mr Gargani will be very keen to ensure that Parliaments independence is respected and I therefore consider this debate now closed P Protests P The debate is closed P The next item is the vote P Despite the Presidents urgings the protests continued",

    "input": "Statement by the President Estonia I have been asked to make a brief statement on Estonia and have been informed that the Group chairmen wish to do likewise once I have finished That does indeed seem to be so The Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950 gave Europe the foundation on which it would be possible to build partnership in peace and freedom between nations that had formerly been at enmity with one another and when our continent formerly divided had grown together the European Union became the guarantor of peace freedom and prosperity throughout Europe We take pride in being able today to celebrate Schuman Day together with 27 Member States of the European Union but 9 May is for other reasons a controversial date as we have seen most recently in the dispute concerning the Soviet soldiers memorial in Tallinn the capital of Estonia and it is for that reason that we call to mind our resolution of 12 May 2005 in which this House remarked upon the fact that there were some nations for whom the end of the Second World War meant the dawn of another tyranny that of the Soviet Union We remind ourselves that controversies on matters of history must never be an occasion for violence and we firmly condemn affray and looting P The current President of the Republic of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves who was formerly a Member of this House said the right thing in response to the events outside the Estonian embassy in Moscow and this was what he had to say about them In Europe it is not customary to demand the resignation of the democratically elected government of a neighbouring country in Europe it is unthinkable that the Convention of Vienna on the protection of diplomatic missions be disregarded P We call to mind our resolution of 8 June 2005 on the protection of minorities and against discrimination against them in which we declared inter alia that national minorities enrich Europe The European Union is founded upon values the protection of which is our common task Putting a Member State of the European Union under pressure constitutes a challenge to all of us and Estonia can count on our solidarity P Applause on behalf of the PPEDE Group Mr President I wish to thank you for your support and solidarity P I should also like to express my gratitude to all colleagues for their extraordinary demonstration of support and solidarity with Estonia because what is happening between an EU Member State Estonia and the Russian Federation is not a bilateral case but a case for the EU as a whole it is a test case of whether the EU is a real political Union rooted in solidarity and unity Today the clarity timing and unity of the EU reaction are being tested What we expect is a strong EU commitment to unconditional solidarity P First of all we need to be free of wishful thinking The way the Russian Federation is treating an EU Member State is clearly not an aberration President Putin presented a programme of a new much more assertive Russian foreign policy in his Munich speech This approach could be termed neoimperialist or revanchist The aim is to regain at least partially its past influence over its former Baltic colonies and then over the former Warsaw Pact part of Europe relying on the current energy boom that has boosted Russian influence as well as misusing parts of the Russian population living outside Russia P I would like to make it very clear that President Putin calls these Russians his compatriots I would like to dispute that strongly Russians living in Estonia are my compatriots and I am proud of them because 99 of them remained loyal not to President Putin but to the Estonian state P Applause P Therefore the question is not only about solidarity the key word is the sovereignty of the new Member States of the European family We can succeed in achieving it only when we speak with one voice and demonstrate unity in action When a Member State that decides to be clearer about its own past and does so in an open and dignified way suddenly becomes an object of concentrated pressure from its huge neighbour when its embassy in Moscow is practically held hostage for a whole week when riots to destabilise law and order are organised with clear inspiration and assistance from a foreign state when there are calls by Russian officials for a democratically elected government to step down when an economic blockade is being implemented when websites of the Estonian state institutions are still being blocked by massive cyber attacks an innovative form of propaganda war then one has to be really worried about the sovereignty of the state in question P In conclusion there is still another form of sovereignty we must defend our right to decide on and assess our past You quoted the resolution of the European Parliament two years ago concerning the many European countries that fell victim to the renewed tyranny inflicted by Stalins Soviet Union There is still a dividing line in Europe between all the western democracies which have never recognised the illegal annexation and occupation of the Baltic States to the Soviet Union in 1940 as a result of the HitlerStalin pact and the Russian Federation which still denies this pact and also tries to deny the right of its former victims to assess their past Therefore we need your solidarity and I am very thankful to all of you for demonstrating it P Applause Thank you very much Mr Kelam As a citizen and an honourable personality from Estonia I gave you twice as much speaking time as you had been allocated but this should not be an example for others on behalf of the PSE Group DE Mr President I hope I am honourable even though I am not from Estonia I asked the leader of our Estonian delegation Mr Tarand to speak Since he will be speaking later on he asked me to make it clear that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament as a whole is giving its full backing to Estonia to our Members from Estonia and to the people of Estonia and that we reject all outside intervention and every intervention on the part of Russia P We affirm not only the principle that embassies and diplomatic premises should be treated with respect but also that the sovereignty of a country and its people should be respected P If I may add a personal remark I was born a few months after the end of the war in what was then the Sovietoccupied zone in Eastern Austria I remember my parents relatives and friends relating how they were glad that Russian soldiers had come to free us from the Nazi regime and also know from personal experience that these same people feared the possibility of the Soviet troops staying on as occupiers It was our good fortune in Austria a good fortune bestowed on us by history that our country was liberated Many others such as the people only 20 kilometres to the east of my home experienced occupation rather than liberation P That is why we believe that Russia should at last come to acknowledge that while many Russian soldiers came as liberators they did bring with them a regime under which the same liberators remained as an occupying power and that many peoples not only in the Soviet Union but also in many neighbouring countries suffered oppression If this were to come to be accepted it would make dialogue so much easier I hope that all citizens on either side of the former border with the Eastern bloc accept that this dual truth was once the case P Our group was very sad to lose Mr Ilves as a member but we are today very glad that such a levelheaded man as he is President of Estonia Here are two short quotations from him He drew attention to the website of a young Russian woman who had written on it We are Russians but our homeland is Estonia to which he added Thank you Maria The last sentence in his speech which really is most remarkable goes like this P It is customary in Europe that differences that occur now and then between states are solved by diplomats and politicians not on the streets or by computer attacks Those are the ways of other countries or I would add other times somewhere else not in Europe P DE What we in Europe need is dialogue and conversation rather than attacks on embassies or demonstrations in front of them because it is this dialogue itself that is of the essence of Europe on behalf of the ALDE Group ET Mr President ladies and gentlemen allow me first of all to reply in the hope that since I am speaking on behalf of my group I shall not be given significantly less time than the previous speaker P Today we are discussing relations between Estonia and Russia and in talking about these we must definitely discuss the events that took place at the end of April in Estonia Nor can we ignore the cause of these events the Bronze Soldier This statue was erected by the Soviet authorities in honour of the liberators of Tallinn The liberation of Tallinn actually consisted of the bombing of Tallinn on 9 March 1944 when 40 of Tallinns residential areas was destroyed and hundreds of people died P This was referred to as liberation but Estonians were deported to Siberia with one wave of deportations following another and no family left untouched by the repression My father was deported to Siberia in 1941 and only returned home 21 years later After Stalins death my greatgrandmother who had also been deported to Siberia set out alone and on foot for her home country of Estonia When my family came home from work one day they found her sitting on the steps of our house but unfortunately my greatgrandmother was already dead I can still remember that time P As a monument erected to a liberator the Bronze Soldier was a symbol of very painful experiences for many Estonians Nevertheless it stood in the central square of our capital city for another 15 years that is to say for the 15 years after Estonia regained its independence P What was it that happened on 26 April What happened that night The monument crisis actually began about a year ago when a gathering of extremists waving Soviet flags transformed this monument from one that honoured the dead into a symbol of the victory of the Soviet occupation and as such it became a continual source of tension Up to that time veterans had gathered there every year and despite the fact that alcohol was sometimes consumed on the grave and that those present even at times danced on the grave the police never intervened P On the night of 26 April however riots broke out in the downtown area and these later spread to some border cities where however they were less severe The rioters destroyed everything that stood in their path including cars and bus pavilions but mainly windows Bands of youths broke into shops and stole everything Offlicences in particular were targeted but also some other shops For example Armani and Hugo Boss shops as well as jewellery stores were looted P Since we live in a media age all of this was recorded and also broadcast live on television Today there is a great deal of video material documenting the events The police only intervened when the gangs of youths became too aggressive Truncheons and water cannons were used firearms were not That night the Bronze Soldier was transported from Tõnismäe to the military graveyard where it was yesterday made accessible to the public again After that the attacks from Russia began the propaganda offensives mentioned by the previous speakers culminating in the Russian Dumas demand for a change of government in Estonia I will stop now Please accept my apologies Mr President P The speech was interrupted P Finally I would like to thank all who have supported and who continue to support Estonia This is a great honour for us and a great help to us Thank you Mr President and please accept my apologies on behalf of the UEN Group Mr President I would like to join my colleagues in firstly giving our solidarity and support to the Estonian Government and to the Estonian people and secondly in denouncing the bullyboy tactics of the Russian Government in its attempt to create uncertainty and instability not only within Estonia but in all the Baltic States P In many ways what we are witnessing is a new form of totalitarianism or authoritarianism by the use of mobs in Moscow to attack an Embassy by the use the power or strength of energy to try and make people kneel before the influence of the Russian Government and most importantly of all by a continuing desire to keep imposing symbols of domination and of subjugation in areas that have gained their independence from totalitarian regimes P Our task and role today is to listen to our Estonian colleagues and to hear their cries and their pleas for assistance and solidarity Most importantly of all however because we value Russia as a partner for future developments we should call on Russia to take the proper steps to ensure that the rights of all European Union Member States are respected equally whether large or small whether a neighbouring country or not whether a former dominion or not P Finally our most ardent call should go out to the citizens of Estonia to show them that now that they are part of the European Union they will not be abandoned as they were abandoned previously on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen we have had this sort of argument about European history many times before the last time we did so it was in a debate on what to make of the Sudeten problem in the Czech Republic when we said and I repeat that what was needed was a European interpretation of the war and that the national interpretations of it had to be put to one side In this instance the European interpretation is a simple matter it is that the Red Army played its part in freeing Europe from National Socialist Fascism That is what it did and this playing of its part demanded great sacrifices Let us leave to one side the argument about what responsibility Stalin bore for Hitlers rise to power for that is another debate P After that though the Red Army became an army of occupation an army that made freedom impossible That too is part of European history Removing hideous bronze statues far from presenting a problem for the cultural landscape of a city tends to help make the place more beautiful but in this debate we have to make it abundantly clear and I hope that we will hear this said in the debate on Russia that the fact of the matter is that what the Russian leadership Putin is trying to do here with all its and his might is to foment division We must all affirm our solidarity with the governments of Latvia and Estonia P At the same time though whatever our solidarity we have to acknowledge that the Baltic states do have a problem with the rights of the Russian minority What history teaches us all is that social conflict arises when a minority and that is what 30 of the population amounts to wants to belong but feels deprived of their rights P I know that all majorities always deny that the Turks have always told us that there is no Kurdish problem in Turkey yet a Kurdish problem is just what there is in Turkey and there is a problem with the Russian minority and their rights This is not to say that the Russian minority is good but that as a minority they have to have rights and that it is difficult to build consensus in society if those rights are not recognised on behalf of the GUENGL Group DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is quite true that 62 years ago today the representatives of Nazi Germany signed the instrument of unconditional surrender thus bringing to an end one of the darkest chapters in European history The peoples of what was then the Soviet Union played a decisive part in bringing this victory about and they also had to pay an enormous price all these things we ought to properly appreciate and of course reflect upon them and it is for that reason that I thoroughly endorse what has been said about the events in Tallinn by the head of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem in these words which I found very moving P Whilst the Centre unequivocally condemns crimes committed against Estonians of all faiths and nationalities under Soviet rule it must never be forgotten that it was the Red Army which effectively stopped the mass murder conducted by the Nazis and their local collaborators on Estonian soil until the final day of its occupation by Nazi Germany Thus the removal of the monument from the centre of Tallinn by the government reflects a regrettable lack of sensitivity to the depth of Nazi criminality and is an insult to its victims P DE My group finds it extremely regrettable that disagreements in Tallinn on matters of domestic and foreign policy should have reached this crisis point and we urge all the parties involved to exercise moderation and enter into dialogue That a peaceful demonstration in the Estonian capital should degenerate into a riot and that the police should act in such a way that one person is killed and many others injured is very disturbing and that it should happen at all testifies to the lack of dialogue between the Estonian majority and the Russian minority What I want to highlight then is that we in this House also share in responsibility for this for having expressed too little opposition to the discrimination against the Russian minority in the Baltic states P The disproportionate responses from Russia are no less disturbing My group strongly endorses the demand made of Russia that it discharge its international obligations in accordance with the relevant conventions and protect not only the premises but also the staff of the Estonian embassy and allow unhindered access to it We also call on the German Presidency of the Council to help deescalate the situation and bring Estonia and Russia together in dialogue With the EURussia summit in the offing this is a time for building bridges rather than barriers on behalf of the INDDEM Group SV Mr President the first and most important thing to state is that Estonia is an independent nation not a Russian satellite state This means that we cannot begin to talk in muted tones about the need to understand Russia and its history Rather we must understand that Russia is mounting a blockade against Estonia and demanding that another countrys government resign etc Emphatically these are not matters for which we should be showing understanding The Russian Government the Russianspeaking minority in Estonia and everyone else do of course have the right to criticise activities such as the removal of a bronze statue However Estonia is not a Russian satellite state within Russias sphere of interest but a free and independent nation P The instances offered by Mr CohnBendit when he begins to talk in this House about quite different issues notably the situation of the minority populations in the three Baltic republics are unhelpful Obviously that is another albeit worthwhile discussion What however we are talking about now is Russias being entitled or rather not being entitled at all to do what it has in fact done The fact in itself extraordinary of the Red Armys having defeated Hitler is irrelevant That victory is something that we can celebrate Subsequently the Red Army settled down to the longterm bullying of Estonia P In 1939 Finland lay north of the Gulf of Finland and Estonia south of it The two countries had approximately the same standard of living and were in many respects quite similar When the Russian occupation came to an end Finland was one of the worlds richest and most successful countries while Estonia which is now very successfully working its way up was in the doldrums These costs must not be forgotten We are not now required to understand Russia What we have to remember now is that it is the independent nation of Estonia that we are talking about not a Russian satellite state on behalf of the ITS Group FR Mr President history has yet to be written with the sole aim of getting close to the truth Until now it has been written in an ideological way Consequently it constantly omits this essential fact namely that the wicked alliance between Molotov and Ribbentrop between Stalin and Hitler that is between communism and national socialism resulted in the violent invasion of Estonia where the presence of the Red Army took the form of arrests deportations arbitrary executions and decades of denial of all civil rights P Today everyone is in favour of the Baltic countries having their freedom but when in October 1987 in the French parliament Mr Le Pen and the members of the group that he was chairing wanted to exclude the Baltic countries the annexation of which we felt was illegal because it was achieved by violent means from the scope of the treaties concluded with Russia all the other political parties were against In reality ladies and gentlemen the Estonians and the Russians were victims of communism Admittedly given the enormous sacrifices subsequently made by the Russian army the humiliation felt by the Russian minority and above all by the former soldiers is understandable The great French poet Baudelaire once said the dead the poor dead have great sorrows P Let us leave Estonia free to find its own methods of being able to honour those whose sacrifice ultimately has no other legitimate meaning than that of having defended their respective nations the independence sovereignty and identity of each of those nations The debate is closed",

    "input": "Oneminute speeches Rule 144 The next item is oneminute speeches Mr President the mounting crisis in relations between Estonia and Russia affects us all What we have is a clear case of undue pressure by a large country against a small one This is the kind of behaviour from which the European Union protects small states Russia has persistently accused Estonia of nurturing something that it calls fascism without producing a shred of evidence The campaign brings the very idea of antifascism into disrepute above all because Russia itself is behaving like a fascist state The campaign dishonours the memory of those who really did fight fascism and especially those who gave their lives in that struggle millions of Russians included Antifascism means democracy and equality of respect for all Russia by contradicting this is reviving fascism and thereby turning into a threat to Europe as a whole Madam President I would like to raise a serious matter of EU funding being misused in my view for the destruction of archaeological heritage in Ireland I appeal to Commissioner Dimas to intervene directly with Minister Roche in Ireland to ensure that these subsidies which are being provided to build the N3 motorway in County Meath are not facilitating the destruction of a recently discovered Neolithic site a woodhenge This is an extremely important site quite close to the historic Tara Hill The Director of the National Museum in Ireland has called for a complete archaeological excavation but given that Minister Roche has been deaf to all expert advice so far there is a real risk that this unique Neolithic site will be lost In view of the European investment in this motorway project it is essential that the Commission step in to ensure that a significant part of not only Irish heritage but by definition also part of European heritage is properly excavated and that if necessary the N3 motorway be reconfigured to achieve that objective IT Madam President ladies and gentlemen I believe that we are about to witness a dishonourable I repeat dishonourable episode in the European Union the responsibility for which rests primarily with the Council and with the inertia of the Commission which are in breach of compulsory mandates that we have given them In December 1994 we were defeated by a mere eight votes when the universal moratorium on the death penalty was about to be established Since then for 13 years the overwhelming majority of the UN has been ready to vote for this great principle of civilisation Since then the European Union has prevented them from voting P Parliament has said during this partsession that the General Affairs and External Relations Council GAERC that will take place on Monday 14 May is probably preparing once again to betray the mandate entrusted to it and to postpone for yet another year this certain victory P Madam President I would ask you to urge the President of Parliament to deal promptly with the issue PL Madam President Polands fruit growers have suffered yet another setback Poor protection of the internal market against excessive imports and dumping has been compounded by frost which has destroyed some 90 of this years harvest The losses estimated at some 15 billion EUR are beyond the means of the Polish Government and insurance companies Low returns on fruit farming particularly soft fruits and especially since Polands accession to the EU has meant a reluctance to insure harvests both by insurance companies and by the farmers themselves who simply cannot afford it This situation requires immediate assistance from the European Union both emergency aid and longterm aid for the coming years If not Polands farmers will be condemned to bankruptcy and the EU to importing its fruit from third countries Madam President the European Commission has wisely dropped plans to enforce complete metrication in the UK It realises that nothing would be more likely to ferment rebellion against the European Union amongst the general population than for them to lose the pound the pint and the mile This is a victory for Britain but it is only a skirmish that has been won The European Union has made a tactical withdrawal in order to fight more strategic battles later The struggle for British independence is still being waged and the final victory when Britain leaves the European Union is still some way off The next big confrontation will be over the revised European Constitution At this point I would like to add my voice to those calling for a posthumous royal pardon to be granted to the metric martyr Steve Thoburn who was convicted in the year 2000 for the heinous criminal offence of selling bananas in pounds and ounces DE Madam President I should like to inform the public and those responsible of an outrageous case of obstructing the work of an independent Member of the European Parliament In Austria the top candidate of the Liberal Forum at the last student elections Martin Ehrenhauser received a letter on 20 April 2007 stating We are offering you a job as a contract agent from 15 May 2007 working for the political group of Nonattached Members in the European Parliament Mr Ehrenhauser travelled here Suddenly the letter is no longer valid The reason a political instruction from the very top from the new Secretary General Harald Rømer P This is unacceptable It was a bolt from the blue and in this case it affects me You will be aware that every Member has the right to work with at least one member of parliamentary staff in his group in his mother tongue I am the only one who is denied this privilege because there is a desire to make the work of an unpleasant critic more difficult At the same time it is precisely the large groups here that allocate themselves legions of staff who are loyal to their party Altogether Parliament employs thousands of staff P I call on the Bureau and those responsible to investigate this case This kind of thing is detrimental to Parliament and it is also detrimental to our understanding of democracy CS Madam President ladies and gentlemen in these postmodern times marriage is becoming less and less popular especially among young people yet it remains the foundation of the family It is thus in the interest of the Member States and of the EU as a whole to support marriage Following our accession to the EU I frequently hear complaints about the longterm complications people face when they marry citizens of other Member States P It is hard for EU citizens to understand that there is no agreement between EU Member States on the mutual recognition of official documents Men and women wanting to get married have to spend time and effort going around numerous offices to complete bureaucratic formalities in order to make the wedding possible For me too as an MEP it is hard to understand why the offices of one Member State refuse to recognise marriage certificates or confirmations of citizenship as stated in normal documents Young people find the process of obtaining current documents and having them superlegalised especially arduous I am under no illusions about our ability to harmonise codes Nevertheless our citizens certainly deserve some simple measures aimed at simplifying those laws LT Russia is behaving disgracefully in Estonia and is not even trying to hide its behaviour The Russians have commenced an economic blockade against a European Union Member State In the past Russia has behaved more subtly in Latvia or Lithuania or in other countries which is perhaps why the European Union has been nonchalant about most of Russias actions After the events in Estonia I urge you to reconsider the European Unions relations with Russia Strategic partnership should be replaced by principled honourable and pragmatic cooperation P In my opinion it is essential to postpone the 18 May meeting in Samara We need to lay out the European Unions opinion to Russia on what conditions are essential for such meetings to be able to take place again in the future Javier Solana must go to Moscow and clearly state the European Unions position Europe has enough arguments My fear is that some European Union leaders will want to have yet another photo opportunity with the antidemocratic Putin rather than defend the European Unions democratic values Madam President I start by saying to you and I hope you will convey this to the President how much I enjoyed the initiative he took in inviting Nobel Prize winners here this afternoon and particularly hearing from distinguished scientists speaking to us in this Chamber We have many issues to deal with colleagues involving science and technology and we do not have enough dialogue with the science and technology community Through this speech tonight I would like to draw to the attention of all my colleagues the fact that the Parliaments own Science and Technology Assessment Unit of which I am privileged to be VicePresident with my colleague Mr Busquin as President is holding a major event in the June Strasbourg week called the STOA Experience There will be exhibitions of recent work and many distinguished scientists will meet and talk to Members about the projects we have under way I hope many colleagues will take a real opportunity to step up dialogue between ourselves in this Parliament and the leaders in the science and technology community within the European Union Thank you for drawing that to our attention Mr Harbour Madam President I would like to emphasise a point which is not universally known in the European Union This is the fact that with the exception of Denmark cars are most expensive in my country the smallest country in the EU This is mainly due to the fact that there is an extraordinary tax called registration tax which is sometimes higher than the value of the car itself This means that in a country where wages are on a par at most with middleincome Europe the price of vehicles whether new or second hand is exorbitant This creates undue stress for middle and lowerincome families when it comes to changing their cars It also affects the whole idea of world climate change Although Malta is small car owners find it terribly difficult to change their cars to more efficient energysaving cars and those which produce less exhaust Madam President as an Irish Member I am delighted to have one minute to add my voice to the many voices who celebrate and applaud what happened yesterday in Belfast Indeed it is fitting that earlier today we congratulated Betty Williams Mairead Corrigan David Trimble and John Hume all Nobel Prize winners for their contribution to peacebuilding and peacemaking in Northern Ireland Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan worked within their communities and that is where real peace building is achieved between people between families between neighbours and between communities But we also need political leadership to drive the process forward and today we honoured two of those politicians David Trimble and John Hume There were many other politicians at different levels who took risks for peace and they too deserve our applause P As we celebrate 50 years of the EU it is most appropriate to recognise that the EU has also played an important role in the peace process in Northern Ireland giving us moral and economic support For that support I believe I can say on my own behalf and on behalf of Irish people thank you to the EU for believing in us and supporting us on the road to peace HU Over the past six years factories on Austrian territory have been continuously polluting the waters of the Rába River The Rába crosses the Hungarian border already filled with polluted foamy water The Hungarian Minister of Environmental Protection who stepped down yesterday gave the Austrian factories until 1 May to stop the pollution but no progress has so far been made On 1 April together with my colleague I personally delivered to the Austrian authorities the petition of the Hungarian delegation of the Peoples Party calling upon the provincial and federal government to take the necessary steps To date we have received no answer to our petition P The AustroHungarian Water Commission which years ago granted the factories an operating licence is currently holding its annual meeting This commission is made up of delegates by the governments of the two States and the revocation of water rights licences likewise falls within their competence We must do everything possible to stop this harmful crossborder environmental pollution therefore I call upon the AustroHungarian Water Commission and thus indirectly on the governments of the two Member States in question in which I request the assistance of Parliament to revoke effective immediately the water rights licences of those factories which are polluting the river Madam President as we celebrate 50 years of European values and fundamental principles democracy in a candidate Member State is struggling to survive The elected Government of Turkey is openly threatened by the countrys biggest enemy its army generals The Turkish army instead of protecting democracy is set on a course to destroy it Irrespective of our personal stance on Turkeys accession to the EU it is to our benefit and to the benefit of the Turkish people that Turkey continues its reform process It is our duty to support the political powers of Turkey represented today by Mr Erdogans Government in their fight against the anachronistic armed forces represented by Chief of Staff General Buyukanit I call upon the President of this House to make a statement as soon as possible to express our strong support for the Government of Turkey and our dismay at the interference of the army in the politics of the country P The European Parliaments message to the Turkish army generals should be loud and clear Keep to your barracks and stop your war on democracy SK I have been following the situation concerning political prisoners in Cuba for quite some time It was with pleasure that I received the news that several opposition groups had recently come up with a joint declaration in which they committed themselves to a united approach in the struggle for a peaceful transition to democracy on the island P The signatories of the declaration include such wellknown dissidents such as Oswaldo Payá from the Christian Democratic Movement for Liberation Elizardo Sanchez from the Cuban Human Rights and National Reconciliation Commission and Martha Beatriz Roque and René Gómez Manzano from the Assembly for the Promotion of Civil Society The document was also signed by the members of the organisation set up by the wives of political prisoners known as the Ladies in White P A unified peaceful opposition is essential to pursuing the changes that are needed by the people One must not overlook the fact that despite some political and philosophical differences these groups share the same goals including respect for human rights reconciliation the release of political prisoners nonviolence and cooperation SK The purpose of my presentation is to warn European consumers who wear Chinese textile products Regrettably many of those products are coloured using azocolourants that do not meet the standards set in Directive 200261EC on azocolourants P When people wear such textile products the azocolourants penetrate the body like silent killers and cause cancer Just as recently as May 2006 the laboratories of an authorised entity operating in the town of Svit Slovakia tested a sample of 90 textile products for children randomly collected on the Slovak market most of them imported from China and found that every fifteenth product was hazardous P One can reasonably assume that large batches of essentially identical textile goods are to be found on the markets of other EU Member States As these are extremely dangerous products I urge the Commission to take effective measures to shorten as much as possible the time between sample collection and the publishing of an alert in the RAPEX system The 35 months or more that it now takes is long enough for the hazardous product to be sold out and disappear from the market I find these facts disconcerting and I strongly believe that we must not remain inactive PL Madam President there is a saying that you can tell who your real friends are in a crisis At the moment Polands soft fruit farmers are facing such a crisis because of the frosts that have hit Poland in recent weeks Soon these farms and their families will sink into poverty Polands farmers are hoping for some support from the EU and that someone will reach out with a helping hand This is what should in fact happen as that is what solidarity means that is what being together and helping one another in difficulty means Lech Wałęsa who is present in this House today could tell you much more about this Help from the European Union will create a good climate and increase our citizens regard for the EU Here in this House in the EU institutions we need to develop instruments at EU level to help those countries regions and industries that have been afflicted by natural disasters That concludes the item",

    "input": "Nominal quantities for prepacked products debate The next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on nominal quantities for prepacked products repealing Council Directives 75106EEC and 80232EEC and amending Council Directive 76211EEC 1348412006 C600392007 Rapporteur Jacques Toubon rapporteur FR Madam President Mr Verheugen ladies and gentlemen the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection recommends that you adopt the Council common position modified by some amendments an amendment comprising a safeguard clause at the end of the transitional periods a provision encouraging the extension of unit pricing a system for guaranteeing that British bread can continue to be marketed in its current sizes and finally a declaration by the Commission that can explain and guarantee exactly the phasing out of stocks of bottles that are offspecification However the heart of this directive is on the one hand freedom in sizing and on the other mandatory sizes for five years for milk pasta butter and coffee and for six years for white sugar That is what is proposed to you P How have we reached this point At first reading on the basis of its own study the European Parliament retained mandatory sizes for a number of products in permanent derogation in relation to the general liberalisation of sizes that was proposed by the Commission The latter in a position of principle set out a revised proposal that was totally opposed to Parliaments text It was then that I was able to resume talks with the Commission and the Finnish Presidency of the Council The latter succeeded in achieving the adoption of a common position that took up some of the derogations requested by the European Parliament but only for a limited period a transitional period P I proposed accepting the main points of this position provided that it was accompanied by two additional guarantees Firstly that the Commission can propose continuing to keep certain mandatory sizes for certain massmarketed products if consumers experienced disruption at the end of the transitional period and secondly that the Member States should be encouraged to extend unit pricing to local shops That is what the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection decided on on the basis of my proposal and it is also what we agreed with the Council and the Commission at the end of two trialogues held over recent weeks P Furthermore ladies and gentlemen I shall draw three lessons from this legislative procedure Firstly on this occasion we have for the first time carried out an impact assessment We commissioned this assessment from an independent body and it was the first time that Parliament had used this procedure which has I believe a great future Secondly what we are doing means that better lawmaking does not necessarily consist in doing away with all legislation because and this is the third lesson I have drawn through this debate we have strictly taken into account the needs of consumers and in particular the most vulnerable consumers P That is why ladies and gentlemen I propose that our Parliament vote tomorrow for the three amendments that have been adopted by the Commission on Internal Market and Consumer Protection VicePresident of the Commission DE Madam President ladies and gentlemen I should like first of all to thank Mr Toubon for his constructive work on this very difficult legislative proposal and agree with everything that he has just said particularly when it comes to the lessons to be learnt that is what we can learn from this dossier I should like to make one additional point I hope very much that the Council will see fit to follow Parliaments example and in future when it is making amendments to legislative proposals that it will also carry out an impact assessment This would certainly help us greatly in our ongoing work of creating better regulation P This is actually just one part of a major project being implemented by the Commission and all of the other institutions better regulation We began with the clear political goal of improving and simplifying the European Unions existing body of legislation Mr Toubon is quite right improving it does not mean abolishing it Improving it means making it simpler more transparent and more manageable Obviously however the levels of protection that we have in place should remain intact In principle all of the institutions and certainly also consumers and business agree with this Despite this agreement of principle however there are always specific reservations once a proposal is actually drafted and tabled Then it becomes clear that a political compromise is needed and I am pleased that in this case we have produced a good solution together P What is this really about We are dealing here with regulations from the 70s and 80s At that time mandatory sizes were laid down for a large number of prepacked products These included such varied goods as toothpaste detergent fish fingers tomato puree solvents and even dry and wet dog and cat food P At the time of their adoption around 30 years ago this was the best way of achieving two aims firstly to open up the internal market for goods even more as provided for in the Treaties of Rome and secondly to ensure the necessary level of consumer protection in the crossborder trade of these goods P Since then however we have significantly developed the internal market and consumer protection within the European Union P Now it is a question of following suit by simplifying and harmonising the regulations on packaging sizes Here less European regulation means more innovation and greater competitiveness P I am convinced that this proposal will have a positive impact in particular for consumers Consumers will gain greater freedom of choice Furthermore thanks to the existing directive on unit pricing pricing per kilogram or litre they will also continue to be able to compare the prices of different packaging sizes easily in the future P I am grateful to the rapporteur for his commitment I also think that we have agreed on transitional rules As Parliament has requested the Commission will review the situation in a few years time There is therefore nothing to prevent an agreement at this second reading on behalf of the PPEDE Group Madam President with slightly more time at my disposal I would like to congratulate you on becoming a VicePresident As a valued colleague of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection it is a pleasure to speak with you chairing the sitting here tonight P I would also like to thank Jacques Toubon who I think has led an outstanding review of this process as the Commissioner has indicated I also echo what the Commissioner said about the way that we approached this I think we were one of the first committees in Parliament to commission an impact assessment on our proposed amendments Some of the issues raised by that have now been reflected in the amendments which we shall support tomorrow particularly concerning what I might call the safeguard clauses that the Commission will be observing in order to closely observe the behaviour of the market P Overall we are very much in support of your aims Commissioner in wanting to push forward to remove unnecessary legislation much of which dates back 20 or 30 years as you indicated Now that consumers are better informed we want them to take advantage of that and to have information about pricing P We want to give manufacturers the flexibility to produce products in different sizes that would suit different family sizes I am bound to say that in my own country and I suspect in others it is such a surprise for them to find the Commission producing a deregulatory measure As you will see from some colourful newspaper stories in my stories in my own country this directive has been freely misinterpreted as in many cases preventing British consumers from having access to their preferred sizes for products I think that you as a Commission need to work on the fact that misrepresentation is so easy because at the moment this is such an unusual proposal In that context I am very grateful to you and to the Council for giving consumers of prepacked bread in the United Kingdom that is over 80 of regular eaters of bread every day assurances that their traditional sizes of loaf which they perceived to be under threat from this proposal are guaranteed and that they will still be able to enjoy and consume every morning with their marmalade toast made in their traditional sizes of prepacked bread on behalf of the PSE Group DE Madam President Commissioner Mr PresidentinOffice ladies and gentlemen I believe that the piece of legislation that we are debating today is very important because the reason why this directive was created in the past was of course to open up the market for goods P Opening up the market and producing nominal quantities have now been replaced by consumer protection How we deal with this proposal is therefore extremely important and that is why the European Parliament has stated clearly that simply doing away with all of the regulations in this sector could lead to difficulties particularly for people with disabilities especially the partially sighted If we look round large supermarkets for example we note that prices are not always displayed as clearly as they might be P For Parliament it is of great importance to appeal to the Member States and say that it is not enough to display prices in units of litres or kilograms in the large supermarkets but that it would also be appropriate to introduce this pricing method in other outlets They should identify ways of achieving this as it is particularly important for vulnerable customers It was very important for us to make this appeal and it is good that it has been heard P The second point that is particularly close to our hearts as social democrats has just been mentioned by my fellow Member Mr Harbour It concerns loaves of bread in the United Kingdom At no stage have either the Commission the Council or the European Parliament wanted to call into question these packaging sizes but the debate in the United Kingdom has taken on a life of its own To make this clear to the people of the United Kingdom it was important to include a corresponding recital in this legislation so that we really could ensure and British Members in particular from the Labour Party have asked me to stress this once more that bread in the United Kingdom will not be affected in any shape or form but that it will continue to be able to be sold in the forms that the British public is used to P A third issue in this context concerned the fact that we wanted to ensure that these nominal quantities would not be abolished automatically after a certain time but that the European Commission would assess the consequences and the possibilities beforehand and would consider by means of an impact assessment whether this was appropriate what consequences could arise as a result and how we might respond to any disruption of the market The detergent market has provided us with an example of what happens when there are no nominal quantities and in that case we could consider what action might be taken on behalf of the ALDE Group FR Madam President Mr Verheugen Mr Lütke Daldrup ladies and gentlemen I should like first of all to congratulate our rapporteur and also to thank him because Mr Toubon has worked in a spirit of complete cooperation with all his colleagues Consequently we have always been informed of his positions and of the progress of the dossier after every discussion with the Commission and the Presidency of the Council Mr Toubon has sought our opinion providing us in good time with clear precise notes which have enabled us to make up our minds with full knowledge of the facts P At the time of the vote at first reading the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe took a stand against maintaining packaging sizes insofar as these mandatory categories did not exist in the 27 Member States and these obligations could hamper innovation and competition by limiting consumer choice The ALDE Group has however come round to the Council common position and supports the idea of transitional periods for certain categories of product P On the other hand the ALDE Group did not necessarily want a revision clause to be entered into the actual body of the directive as it felt that the reference to this review clause in a recital sufficed Recognising however the persuasive powers of the rapporteur the ALDE Group will support him on this point as I might add it will support his amendments as a whole P Aside from this vote however may I express my regret that none of the institutions has taken up the idea of concordance tables which appeared in Article 8 of the basic proposal In accordance with the Better lawmaking interinstitutional agreement the Member States are in fact encouraged to establish for themselves and in the Community interest their own concordance tables between the directives and the transitional measures and above all to make them public This point is particularly important for the ALDE Group which is very committed to improving information for consumers and beyond that which is fighting for better information for European citizens SV Madam President the Swedish Members of the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats are opposed to a Packaging Directive Ideally we would want to do away with the whole directive I have made efforts to rescue Swedish milk packages reduce bureaucracy and prevent a debate on milk snatching P The rapporteur Mr Toubon has negotiated and reached a compromise with Members of the European Parliament and with the Council The compromise now looks quite different P Todays date is 9 May a day of peace for Europe The motto is jaw not war and in that spirit I shall try to do my bit Negotiations presuppose compromise Whoever is able to compromise contributes to the development of Europe It is more difficult to say yes in the right place than to say no I personally am in favour of Mr Toubons compromise irrespective of whether or not my Swedish fellow Members are This is my way of celebrating 9 May that is to say by showing some additional willingness to compromise on the issue of a Packaging Directive for it is in that way that modern Europe is being built stone by stone compromise by compromise I also want to try to help so I am agreeing to the proposal and would conclude by saying P FR My respects Mr Toubon In fact Mrs Cederschiöld Mr Toubon is behind you on the other side In any event the debate is closed P The vote will take place tomorrow",

Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers and of systems components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles Framework Directive 0991132006 C600402007 Rapporteur Malcolm Harbour rapporteur Madam President it is a pleasure to be able to present this report on behalf of the committee tonight I would like to pay tribute to my colleague Mr Gargani who handled the report at first reading a substantial amount of work was done by Parliament at that stage I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council because we have worked very hard together on an extremely complex and technical proposal In total it is a report of almost 400 pages which must be one of the biggest reports to come before this Parliament In particular Commissioner I would like to thank your own staff Mr SchulteBraucks and Mr Delneufcourt who I think has been largely responsible for many of those 400 pages I think he deserves a special mention this evening P This is a very important report in terms of completing the internal market for motor vehicles The whole basis of technical regulation for motor vehicles was one of the earliest areas of harmonisation within the European single market but it has taken until now for us to have a fully comprehensive typeapproval framework for all categories of motor vehicles trailers major component systems and critical components Therefore on Europe Day I think this is a notable achievement that we have reached at this stage This of course means that we will get the benefits of improved environmental and safety standards for vehicles consistent and independent validation of performance and that true level playing field we often hear businesses talking about We have actually achieved that in this case In particular I think the ability of manufacturers of all scales and sizes to be able to get their vehicles approved by a national typeapproval authority to a European regulation and to be able to sell those vehicles in every market across the European Union is a major step forward P At second reading we have an unusually large number of amendments that were tabled and will be voted on tomorrow These reflect a lot of further improvement and work on our part I would just like to highlight some of those points this evening I am particularly grateful to the Council also and I am pleased that Mr Deldrup will be speaking as well which I think is an indication of the importance that the Council attaches to this important file P First of all we have had some debate to finalise some of the issues around the typeapproval for buses and the timescale for that The bus sector is important because this typeapproval directive brings into play the bus directive that many of us worked on This brings with it notable safety improvements and important issues like disability access to all types of buses This will essentially be brought into play as the single homologation approval framework for buses across the European Union P The second aspect which was a new element of the directive added between first and second reading was the provision to apply a new scheme of type approvals for aftermarket parts which affected the environmental and safety systems of vehicles It is important that we have an approval process for those categories of parts so that we have very full consumer protection in that area But equally this brings the whole of the typeapproval process into the focus of many small and mediumsized businesses Therefore together with the other institutions I worked hard to ensure that we had a very effective procedure first of all for identifying those parts and to ensure that the producers of those parts were involved in that and to develop the new test standards that would be required for approval But of course having done that it allows the producers of those parts and particularly tuning and other companies to have access to the single market with a single approval I think that is a major benefit that they are very pleased to have P Another aspect that we looked at was the approval procedure for small series vehicles Mr Gargani asked for the lower volume vehicle limit to be raised and a compromise has been reached to raise that to a thousand vehicles for simplified type approval a major benefit for the smaller serious producers We also identified that there was an important category of vehicle for disabled users wheelchair accessible vehicles which were series volume vehicles modified to allow access by wheelchair passengers With the support of the Commission and the Council I propose that we should devise a new category for that type of vehicle The producers of those vehicles which are growing in importance are very pleased to be recognised in that way and are also confident that this will bring into play a new attention to the needs of disabled users as well as the strength and fittings of wheelchairs and so on We will have a vehicle here in Brussels tomorrow to show what we have achieved P In conclusion this is a very important step forward for the single market It has been my privilege to handle it on behalf of Parliament and I commend it to this House for support tomorrow PresidentinOffice of the Council DE Madam President Mr VicePresident of the Commission ladies and gentlemen tomorrow you will be voting on an important new directive on the type approval of cars lorries buses and their trailers We in the German Presidency are delighted that we have been able to reach a prior agreement with the European Parliament on the remaining outstanding issues P We should like to thank you Mr Harbour and your colleagues very much for the good and constructive cooperation This is an important step towards increasing road safety and vehicle safety in the Community and towards making the internal market in motor vehicles a reality The new directive extends the European type approval that has hitherto only been foreseen for passenger cars to lorries buses and their trailers Manufacturers of these vehicles will therefore also be able to benefit from the advantages of the European type approval in the future At the same time the directive ensures that in the future all new vehicles in the European Union will have to meet the same high safety standards The new directive will therefore benefit not only the European automotive industry but also the public throughout the Community P We are counting on your support in tomorrows vote and we will then adopt the directive at one of our forthcoming Council meetings so that it can enter into force as quickly as possible VicePresident of the Commission DE Madam President ladies and gentlemen I should like to offer particularly warm congratulations to the rapporteur Mr Harbour on his report and to thank him for his work which has yielded a really excellent result P This proposal for a directive consists of a whole package of measures which are intended to speed up the process of placing vehicles on the market in the Member States This will indeed as the representative of the German Presidency has just stressed bring huge advantages for manufacturers freight forwarders and users P Making the internal market a reality is indisputably one of the greatest success stories in European politics However when it comes to commercial vehicles manufacturers have hitherto waited in vain for borders to be fully opened P Since 1996 the directive on the type approval of motor vehicles has been the European Communitys most important legal instrument for creating the internal market in the automotive sector It was then that all classes of vehicles were given access to the internal market The only exceptions were commercial vehicles that is buses lorries and their trailers despite the fact that this is a sector of huge economic importance In 2006 alone two million new vans and more than a quarter of a million new lorries of over 16 tonnes were licensed in the Community The vast majority of these vehicles were built in the European Union In 2007 these figures will be substantially exceeded if the data available for the first quarter are anything to go by P This new framework directive seeks above all to extend the principle of a standard Communitywide typeapproval procedure to all vehicles In addition automotive manufacturers will no longer need to build vehicles in line with the regulations in each individual Member State to be permitted to sell them there Instead harmonised technical specifications will apply bringing economies of scale into play and avoiding outdated administrative procedures Haulage companies will also benefit from this and in the end consumers P A further essential point in this directive is that new vehicles will have to comply with a whole series of directives on technical harmonisation in the field of vehicle safety Precisely at a time when commercial vehicles do not enjoy a good reputation amongst the public this will make a decisive contribution to improving road safety across the European Union P Obviously small and mediumsized enterprises have not been forgotten They too will have easier access to the internal market Manufacturers of special purpose vehicles or small series vehicles and bodybuilders who usually work on behalf of haulage companies will benefit from simplified procedures which will not involve too much red tape P I fully agree with Mr Harbours point about those companies that modify vehicles to meet the needs of disabled users It was very important to find a way to resolve this problem together I am delighted that the recommendations made by the CARS 21 high level group that was set up on my initiative have been incorporated unchanged into this proposal for a directive CARS 21 has enabled us to define the legislative framework within which we will move when designing future technical regulations P There is one further important point to be mentioned here international regulations are becoming increasingly significant in this case regulations that are currently being drafted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe An additional factor is that in various respects we are abolishing outdated Community law and are allowing manufacturers to submit their own test results to obtain a type approval P On the tension between the Communitys rules on languages and the direct reference to international standards and regulations I should like to say that the Commission accepts Amendment 25 because it believes that in this particular industrial sector a direct and uptodate reference to such standards may significantly enhance its competitiveness This applies both at global level and within the EU The automotive sector is a global business It therefore has a greater and more urgent need for international standards than some other sectors P The Commission supports the amendments to enable an agreement at second reading and is convinced that this proposal constitutes a balanced response to the interests of industry haulage companies and consumers as well as the needs of the Member States on behalf of the PPEDE Group DE Madam President I too should like firstly to thank the rapporteur Mr Harbour for his excellent and very professional work on this dossier I can fully support the compromise that has been negotiated with the Presidency P I should therefore like to comment briefly on just one point which we have already considered in the debate on Euro 5 and which is particularly important to me namely access to vehicle repair information for independent garages This access to information is of crucial importance for European citizens Anyone who is on holiday travelling in Europe in his car can break down abroad Often however the nearest authorised repair garage is hundreds of miles away That is why we need to ensure that free independent garages are also able to repair that motor vehicle Furthermore all drivers in their home countries should also be able to choose the garage where they would like their vehicle to be repaired This competition will definitely also benefit consumers We will guarantee this with our new rules P To this end we have included an explicit provision in the new typeapproval framework directive stating that vehicle manufacturers have to make all of the necessary information readily available to independent garages to ensure that they are able to repair and maintain a motor vehicle This provision is consistent with the wording of the Euro 5 Regulation which we adopted last year at its first reading Our objective is to guarantee access to repair information for independent garages This should be ensured for a transitional period by Euro 5 but should ultimately be provided for in the typeapproval framework directive P Finally I should like to appeal once more to Commissioner Verheugen to ensure that the political will of Parliament and the Council is respected in the negotiations on technical implementation because the provisions on access to repair information also have to work in practice on behalf of the PSE Group DE Madam President Mr PresidentinOffice Commissioner Verheugen I too am delighted that we have reached an agreement between the three European Union institutions at the second reading so that we can vote tomorrow and then have these provisions implemented very quickly P For the Socialist Group in the European Parliament three points were of particular importance The first is that we were able to agree in Article 31 to retain a high level of consumer protection in approval procedures for parts or equipment which pose a significant risk to the correct functioning of systems P Secondly the text that was adopted in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection by and large clarifies the technical administrative provisions on type approval and extends them at Community level to all motor vehicles including buses and commercial vehicles If we also implement these provisions we will be able to contribute to a significant improvement in road safety P Thirdly I should like to highlight in particular the fact that the provisions on adapting vehicles to the specific needs of people with disabilities have thanks in no small measure to the rapporteur been improved considerably I am thinking here especially of people in wheelchairs We have taken a major step forward here and in so doing we are giving the public a positive image of a Europe that puts the concerns of its citizens and the public at the heart of its work The debate is closed P The vote will take place tomorrow",

    "input": "EU partnership in the Horn of Africa debate The next item is the report by Filip Kaczmarek on behalf of the Committee on Development on the Horn of Africa EU Regional political partnership for peace security and development rapporteur PL Madam President this report on the strategy of the European Union in Africa and the EU political partnership in the horn of Africa will be the European Parliaments response to the European Commissions communiqué of last November The purpose of that communiqué was to create a regional political partnership in the Somalian peninsula as the basis for a comprehensive approach to preventing conflict in the region It is based on the assumption that without lasting peace there can be no development and without development there can be no lasting peace P There were two reasons for selecting this region as a test case for EU regional strategy in Africa The first was the strategic importance of the region for the EU and the second was the great political complexity of the three main conflicts in the region which are interlinked the conflicts in Sudan Ethiopia Eritrea and Somalia where a regional approach is probably the only way of resolving the conflicts In other words nothing can be resolved until everything has been resolved P The strategy proposed by the Commission is based on a comprehensive approach to preventing conflicts in the horn of Africa aiming to tackle the underlying causes of the instability in the short and medium term both at national and at regional level and to bring about closer regional cooperation You may however justifiably wonder whether this is possible in a region where five out of seven states are in conflict with their neighbours where each conflict spawns another where one country has been incapable of functioning normally in the last 15 years and where an extremely high percentage of the population lives in poverty Is cooperation through regional partnership the cure to all the ills of such complex and mutually interlinked problems It is my firm belief that it is worth trying and that despite certain shortcomings in the Commissions communiqué some of which were difficult to avoid and which we address in the report an example is greater involvement of MEPs and of the Africans themselves in drawing up the common strategy we should agree on the four main legs of this strategy which are that sustainable development is impossible without peace and viceversa that without the effective participation of African regional institutions there can be no lasting peace that the regional perspective that is regional understanding is necessary to resolve particular local conflicts and that regional integration initiatives will be successful if they focus on common challenges rather than on a list of present conflicts Regional integration must concentrate on issues such as water resources desertification food security and not simply on ethnic divisions and conflicts Furthermore the European Union has a key role to play by importing its own triedandtested model of integration which has effectively brought lasting peace and which in the context of the present 50th anniversary of the EU is in my view particularly important P I am clearly aware that both the communiqué of the Commission and the present report of the European Parliament is only the beginning of the process and that the ultimate aim is to develop a regional strategy for the region It should also be borne in mind that specific Member States are conducting their own activities in the horn of Africa and the report is therefore directed not just at the European Commission but at Member States as well P The aim of the report is to flesh out the ideas of the Commissions communiqué and I would like to stress particularly that it is important to avoid wishful thinking and cobbling together institutions In my opinion we should rely on existing initiatives and tested ideas We need to appoint a special representative of the European Union for the horn of Africa to deal with the major questions that the report raises This will help avoid duplication allow deeper analysis and make it possible to pursue minimum political aims in individual countries We must make full use of dialogue based on Article 8 of the Cotonou Memorandum cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on creating a common strategy with the involvement of Africa and searching for African solutions and strengthened African organisations P I would also like to thank all those who contributed to this report the MEP from the Committee on Development the secretariat of the Committee on Development the shadow rapporteur the German presidency and the experts and nongovernmental organisations with which we were in constant dialogue Madam President ladies and gentlemen in his report Mr Kaczmarek shares for the most part the Commissions analysis concerning the need for a comprehensive regional approach The ideas put forward by Mr Kaczmarek concerning the path to be followed confirms most of the priorities proposed by the Commission especially with regard to functional cooperation and regional cooperation P The resolution and prevention of conflicts in the Horn of Africa is not from our point of view possible except by means of action at two levels The first level concerns the standard way of mediation and diplomatic action The current situation in the Horn quite obviously demands far more vigorous and I might add far more unanimous action from the entire international community The second level concerns a structuring action for the prevention of conflicts in the medium term The aim is to tackle from the root the problems that affect the countries in the region by addressing common development problems that also have an impact in terms of security and stability P It is this second way that is proposed in the regional strategy for the Horn of Africa which the Commission presented in its communication of October 2006 I wish to make it clear that the primary aim of the communication is to provide a political framework that recognises the nature of the challenges posed in the region of the Horn and identifies the main routes possible for action by the European Union P The communication identifies three priorities for intervention Firstly to act on the national problems that have regional ramifications secondly to tackle regional and transversal problems that are sources of conflicts and instability and finally to foster regional integration Precisely as the report emphasises it is important for there to be genuine ownership a proper political ownership of this strategy not only on the part of the countries of the Horn but also at European level That is why we appreciate for its true value the involvement of the European Parliament on this issue and the report by Mr Kaczmarek P Since the Commission communication was presented last October I have followed with great interest Parliaments debates on the regional strategy for the Horn and I also personally took part last February in the debate within the Committee on Development Positive discussions have also taken place at the level of Council working parties since October P It is in fact a progressive process that we want to create and not to impose The important thing is that the process has now been started with the support of the Heads of State or Government in the region The Commission already organised on 23 April a conference with the personal representatives of the Heads of State or Government This meeting was very positive and promising P This wideranging and intense consultation process enables us to enter confidently and in good order into the realisation phase We are therefore on the right track The report that you will adopt tomorrow will be a very important support and of course a source of inspiration and direction when it comes to conducting the dialogue that will take place over the next few months P I should like to point out that the regional programming for the 10th European Development Fund for the Horn will naturally be largely determined by the results of this process of identifying priority actions I should also like to point out that the strategy for the Horn proposed by the Commission is not intended to supplant the strategies prepared in the context of the 10th European Development Fund It is there in a way to supplement them Likewise it will not replace the necessary parallel action for resolving crises and conflicts which must continue at the political and diplomatic level as I stressed at the beginning of my speech P I therefore fully subscribe to the reports recommendations in relation to governance and to the strengthening of the political dialogue There are two points in the report that also seem to me very important but that go beyond the regional framework of the Horn and of the proposed strategy the Joint European UnionAfrica strategy and the African peace and security architecture P I could respond on these two points also as well as tackle other subjects relating to the Horn of Africa and to the actions that we could take there but the speaking time prevents me from doing so However I shall perhaps have the opportunity to return to these subjects later when I respond to your comments on behalf of the PSE Group Madam President thank you very much to Mr Kaczmarek and to the Commissioner for his response to the report P In the Horn of Africa one hardly knows where to begin because what we see is a lethal cocktail of conflict and poverty where the rule of law barely exists where there is no concept of democracy and human rights and where five out of seven of the countries of the region are in conflict with their neighbours So as the rapporteur says there can be no real security and there can be no developments without peace The key issues are related to building peace preventing conflict and resolving conflict Those are the central elements in the report P It is very important to point out that as the Commissioner is very well aware in other regions of Africa for example West Africa I was recently in Côte dIvoire and in the Great Lakes area we are now seeing peace breaking out But the Horn of Africa stands out as the one region where we have not been able to grapple with conflict management and prevention Certainly the idea of an envoy and other suggestions are very welcome indeed P What we see are the worst examples of conflict In Darfur the UN says that some 200 000 people have died and two million have been displaced since that conflict began in 2003 The Government of Sudan continues to ignore efforts at mediation including from the UN SecretaryGeneral The border disputes between Eritrea and Ethiopia remain unresolved The Government of Ethiopia continues to break international law as far as that is concerned The leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia refuse to give the people the right to choose their own government and to respect elections as has been the case in Ethiopia Now we see intense fighting in Somalia where about a thousand people have died and where Ethiopian troops have been very active fighting on behalf of the transitional government in Somalia but of course as we all have to acknowledge with covert assistance from the United States The Eritreans meanwhile back the Islamist militias P I have written to the Commissioner on this subject and would still like to ask him why it is that we have offered such support to the transitional government in Somalia and why we are not asking serious questions about the bloody process which we are apparently continuing in many ways to tolerate There is a humanitarian catastrophe looming in Somalia and we are still not holding those responsible in the transitional government accountable for their actions Why Commissioner are we not asking questions Is it political expediency that prevents us from doing that Why is it that the Ethiopians do not leave Why is it that security cannot be established Why is there no genuine power sharing and is the EU insisting that moderates in the Islamic courts must be involved in any possible solution in Somalia P Finally I have to ask whether the EU is serious about statebuilding in the Horn of Africa or whether we are actually focusing on other priorities May I suggest that the other priorities in the Horn of Africa are the socalled war against terror on behalf of the ALDE Group LT In its communiqué EU strategy for Africa EU regional policy of partnership for peace security and development in the Horn of Africa which appeared in 2006 the Commission shows its inability to find ways to solve the problems in the Horn of Africa when it states that without longterm peace there will be no development and without development there will be no longterm peace This is a vicious circle Both factors need to occur at once but as we see in reality this is not plausible In the Horn of Africa neither the African Strategy nor Articles 8 and 11 of the Kotonu Agreement are working Regional instability and military conflicts in which more than one country is taking part particularly the savage situation in Darfur show that a special crisis management model is needed for the Horn of Africa which would include the elimination of military conflict hotspots and the creation of peaceful economic social and political life P The EU provides more than 55 of the worlds development cooperation humanitarian aid With military activities taking place in the Horn of Africa it is not really possible to assess what humanitarian aid is needed when it should start and when it should end and when it will be possible to get on with achieving the true goals of development cooperation policy namely the implementation of the Millennium Goals and the reduction of poverty in the countries of the Horn of Africa I would like to emphasise that the EU must coordinate its support and actions in the Horn of Africa with other countries such as for example China India and the USA which have economic interests in the countries of the Horn of Africa Otherwise there is little likelihood of any real progress in the creation of peace and security in this region These countries likewise the United Nations and other organisations together with the EU must create a special model of crisis management for the Horn of Africa PL Madam President first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Kaczmarek for preparing this report It is quite a difficult and important report about an area where the European Union has not yet promoted itself much The area in question is the Somali peninsula whose countries are in a constant state of conflict a territory where it is difficult to talk of rule of law democratic institutions or human rights It is one of the least developed regions in the whole world P The most important thing for the European Union at the present time is to build institutions that would guarantee an end to armed conflict in the peninsula that would protect a minimum of human rights and would lead to governments based on rule of law P Madam President I would like to recall the great political traditions the great traditions of the model of development that followed World War II which accompanied the fight against colonialism by the countries of Europe and the United States in the establishment of new states and democracies in areas that had previously been colonised Perhaps issues such as nationbuilding establishing national institutions and strong governments capable of guaranteeing rule of law are the underlying response that the European Union should be making P I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Kaczmareks proposals such as setting up a special representative of the European Union for the Somali peninsula and EU assistance to African countries to establish regional institutions of cooperation Madam President honourable Members my reply will be a relatively brief one although a whole debate would be needed of course to deal with the question P While I do of course endorse the analyses and judgments that I have heard on the subject of the democratic credentials of certain countries in the Horn of Africa I am a little bit more cautious about the involvement of the Commission and of the European Union P Today the Horn of Africa is a region of which it can be said that the Commission is wholly committed to it and it is without doubt the region to which I myself devote most time Mrs Kinnock was of course talking about Ethiopia and she was quite right to do so for there is a problem with it in international law one that I might add I am continually raising with its prime minister when I am in contact with him in the course of my work on bilateral relations one on which indeed I am working on a virtually daily basis I carry the messages that have to be carried particularly where political prisoners are concerned I also know that efforts are being made by people at a very high level to move this issue forward P Turning to Somalia let me say that I am astonished that it should be said that we were not saying anything to the transitional government and I would point out that I was literally obliged to make available EUR 15 million to the Ugandan stabilisation force in Somalia virtually without conditions attached even though I had been completely opposed to this if the principle of inclusivity were not adhered to from the outset After we had made our position clear and I had imposed that condition President Youssouf promised us that he would organise a national congress of reconciliation We are still waiting for it Since then a debate such as this one is suited to this purpose I have to tell you that if in Somalia things are not going well or moving forward at a good pace it is for two essential reasons P The first is that the conflict in Somalia and the issue of Somalia are not being considered in the context of the Horn of Africa as a whole and that Somalia in a number of cases has become a battlefield for conflicts between outsiders and that is indeed the case the difference between Ethiopia and Eritrea touches upon the Somalia question P Failure to move forward failure to find a solution is also for a second reason of which Mrs Kinnock has given examples In the international community there are two points of view Try as one might to pretend that there is only one the fact of the matter is that there are two points of view to be found in the international community the first of which tends to be held by the European Union and the second by the United States Whenever one of the big players in the international community chooses as a matter of preference what we shall call a strategy of privileged partnership with another and when we are invited by our own Member States to match it exactly with the other international partners as someone has just done we do find ourselves in a number of cases following behind and so I would say that we are thus not in a position to act in a truly autonomous manner on the basis of how we ourselves see things and relying on our own judgment That is the truth of the matter I no longer want that state of affairs to be tolerated since it really is too easy to say to someone you are not doing enough you have to organise coordination with our partner that is to say with the United States I am not criticising the United States who have the right to their own strategy but I do think that if the European Union were able from time to time to have greater strategic autonomy and more independence in these matters we would without a doubt be much more effective P This is what I wanted to tell you perhaps I might also tell you that what I have been doing over the past few months particularly where political dialogue is concerned has been in essence devoted to the Horn of Africa The reason why I present this strategy by means of a report that applies it and is excellent by the way is precisely because I think that the European Union is not entitled to refrain from taking the initiative in this matter and because I tell myself that the situation is so complex and so difficult that we have to start by trying to get all the stakeholders around one negotiating table in order to sort out the problems that they have in common and to find common solutions all with the object of putting them in a position where there is a prospect of dialogue a dialogue that is something different from discussing without calling a halt to the conflicts between them In other words let us open up the prospect of something being done about infrastructure about food safety about drought about pastoralism about water about all these issues in which they have a common interest and then perhaps there might be a chance of doing something about political matters P This is what I wanted to say it is true that we have to coordinate our actions with the other major decisionmakers I think that very sincerely but I also think that we need from time to time to take up our own position on such matters as Somalia I do think that if we had been able to take our ideas to their logical conclusion and say we will not give a cent for this stabilisation force until such time as the National Reconciliation Congress is up and running we would have been in a much stronger position P I will also say and it is on this point that I will finish that I have also sent a letter couched in extremely precise and strong terms to President Youssouf in order to remind him of his commitment to inclusivity in resolving this conflict

    "input": "Environmental protection from radiation following the crash of a military aircraft in Greenland debate The next item is the report by Diana Wallis on behalf of the Committee on Petitions on the public health consequences of the 1968 Thule crash petition 7202002 rapporteur Madam President Commissioner this report follows on well from the last debate which was on the general nature of the Euratom Treaty past present and future This is an actual specific individual case which clearly highlights why this Treaty needs looking at in order to ensure the future safety of Europes citizens in the event of nuclear incidents P This nuclear incident and its sad aftereffects for certain individuals have wider implications for the health and safety of all our citizens It is of course the strength of our petition system that it allows individuals to bring such events to our attention when the European institutions or legal framework have not assisted as they would have wished or expected Our citizens are telling us that the Euratom Treaty is not working so we should listen P Let me take you back to an Arctic night in January 1968 still the era of the Cold War indeed the facts of this story sound like an international thriller An American B52 bomber gets into trouble the crew scramble to safety and the plane comes down in Greenland with an enormous amount of weaponsgrade plutonium on board Residents of Greenland working at the American base at Thule immediately set out across the ice with husky teams to get to the downed plane the Americans desperate to get there before anyone else Over the weeks that follow many Thule workers were involved in the clearup They were not working in laboratory conditions They were not wearing any protective clothing except against the cold indeed the clothing that many of them wore was so contaminated by radiation that it had to be destroyed Over the months and years that followed the Thule workers began to suffer all sorts of terrible health consequences Mr Carswell the petitioner in this case was one of them P This is a long story which has been all through the Danish courts and has been the subject of many reports debates and discussions We are looking here at a very specific issue in the saga namely the rights of the Thule workers under Council Directive 9629Euratom of 13 May 1996 laying down the basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation All sorts of legal arguments have been raised against the petitioners and I do not seek to deal with those in detail here but will merely say that they are set out and dealt with seriously in the report the question of both the temporal and geographic application of the Treaty to Greenland and the issue of the application to military incidents This was not a military incident as far as the Member State involved is concerned The military element is from a third state so we following in the steps of the ECJ argue that the Directive can indeed apply P But this is not just some legal argument this is above all a political argument an argument that could even be pursued under the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the duty of a state to take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within its jurisdiction However what we are absolutely clear about is that there is a right under the Directive for medical monitoring of the survivors proper surveillance and intervention measures not merely statistical exercises as have been conducted to date but proper clinical medical monitoring that would benefit not only those survivors but also the health and safety of all Europes citizens in the event of such future incidents If this is not allowed then it tells us that the Treaty is not working and that is why it needs review and attention P I am afraid that I must also urge colleagues to reject the amendments They are confused or refer to unspecified events not mentioned in the petition or they try to undermine the argumentation of the report Therefore on behalf of the Thule survivors and in the hope of future work to review the Treaty I commend the report to you unamended Madam President firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this very important petition The Commission has full sympathy with the petitioners who have undergone a very difficult time following their participation in the rescue operations after the air crash in 1968 At the same time I would say that over the past five years the Commission has followed this case very closely It has studied it carefully from the legal point of view and has cooperated with the Committee on Petitions and with its rapporteur P The Commission reached the conclusion that the claims brought by the petitioners in this case cannot be based on Community law but solely on the basis of Danish national legislation before the Danish administration and courts In view of these elements this case calls for a political rather than a legal solution I believe that the proposed European Parliament resolution could be one of the elements to help such a political solution P In order to ensure that Euratom legislation covers future situations such as the one which originated in the petition the Commission will examine the possibility of making a relevant provision on the application of the radiation protection requirements in situations arising from military applications The inclusion of such a provision could be undertaken in the framework of the forthcoming revision and recasting of Directive 9629Euratom laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation However the compatibility of such a provision with the caselaw needs to be examined in detail on behalf of the PSE Group Madam President I will not read from my notes I will say what I feel not what I ought to say P The Commissioner offers his sympathy but we do not need sympathy What is needed is the enforcement of fundamental rights which are critical here the right of access to information in order for you to be completely certain that what has happened to you is not lifethreatening P The easiest thing here would be to attack the government of one of the Member States I do not what to do that I want to seek to achieve a solution on behalf of the petitioners P Commissioner you talk of a political solution Well I wish to inform you that this is a political institution which is why we are approaching the European Commission to help us achieve that solution P The solution will not come through sympathy but through the determination to ask the Danish Government under the auspices of good and loyal cooperation which is enshrined in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam to acquiesce to the request for information from the petitioners and workers who formed an association and cleaned up after this tragedy Therefore do not sympathise with them but lend them the Commissions political clout and support and enquire of the Member State as to whether it will release information that is essential to these people in terms of ensuring that they are not at risk and that their lives are safe and in good hands That is all we ask P I shall detain the House no longer I am tiring of the Commissions response to the effect that it is nothing to do with us That is the simplest way to reinforce the Euroscepticism that is growing across the EU and which sadly is prevalent in Denmark on behalf of the ALDE Group Madam President this is a unique report on a unique petition and Mrs Wallis has dealt with it excellently Legal matters aside the petition on which the report is based raises some important points I shall briefly mention three of them P Point one Even with the greatest of safety precautions a nuclear weapons accident is always possible In a way the US B52 crash in Greenland was very fortunate Imagine the effects of it happening in a highly populated area for example near a US base in central Europe So anybody who claims nuclear weapons are absolutely safe in peace time is not telling the whole truth P Point two After a nuclear accident wellprepared plans should immediately be put in action which would minimise the shortterm and longterm effects to human health and to the environment It seems that the relevant authorities in this case the US air force and the Danish Government were illprepared and did not deal with the problem properly especially as regards protecting the civilian personnel and providing them with longterm health surveillance and monitoring This shortfall has led to numerous premature deaths from cancer in cases where early detection could have provided a much better chance of survival so anybody who claims that the relevant authorities can deal most adequately with the aftereffects of a nuclear weapons accident is also not telling the whole truth P Point three After a nuclear weapons accident one expects that the government concerned would display a spirit of transparency and cooperation in dealing with the affected population This was not the case with the Greenland crash as the Danish Government refused to provide access to the relevant environmental radiation records needed to estimate the radiation doses received by affected workers Furthermore the information given by the Danish authorities was dangerously misleading So even scientific reports issued by governments after a nuclear weapons accident cannot be trusted P The overall message is therefore clear Nuclear weapons can cause death and suffering even in peace time so the best way to deal with them is not to have them at all After listening to the Commissioner my final observation would be that petitioners who have endured years of suffering and struggle seem only to receive a lot of sympathy from the EU but no practical assistance on behalf of the UEN Group PL Madam President I would like to start by thanking Diana Wallis for her as usual excellent report and take pleasure and satisfaction in saying that we have in this House a rapporteur who always delivers highly accurate reports particularly from the legal point of view which is extremely important here P In 1968 a US aircraft crashed with nuclear weapons on board The writer of a petition which reached our Committee suffered problems with his health and believes that he was not adequately compensated P The Committee was again the last resort for a large number of people who had nowhere else to seek justice This gave rise to an interesting legal aspect which Mrs Wallis dealt with excellently The accident took place in 1968 while Denmark together with Greenland joined the European Union in 1973 and in 1985 Greenland left the European Union while the Directive establishing basic safety standards in the event of such accidents that is Directive of the Council 9629EURATOM dates from 13 May 1996 Although from the dates themselves it appears that the author of the petition stood no chance of seeking justice here Diana Wallis proved that according to the precedents of the ECJ new provisions of community law are fundamentally applicable to the future outcome of events that took place before prior legislative acts came into effect such as Greenlands withdrawal from the European Union P If states actually applied the relevant directives the Committee on Petitions would have fewer problems to deal with I would like to recall just three cases the Lloyds case the Equitable Life case and the matter of local planning abuses in Spain which were brought simply because the relevant directives were not properly implemented in the countries in question The injured parties are entitled to remedy for damage suffered and we are all entitled to security in the future on behalf of the VertsALE Group DA Madam President this is a grim state of affairs It is absurd and quite indefensible that nuclear weapons should have been flown around in this negligent way during the Cold War That is what is really scandalous about the Thule case Unacceptable though it is to treat nuclear weapons so carelessly that is no reason for allowing ourselves to state something that has proved to be untrue We have no documentation to indicate that any of the Thule workers died as a result of radiation Nor can we maintain that the relevant health checks were not carried out They were in fact carried out and the results show the opposite of what the petitioner and now also the report assert That is something that we have to respect P The amendments by the Group of the GreensEuropean Free Alliance are designed to remove errors and unwarranted assertions That being said we agree with Mrs Wallis that Denmark cannot avoid the fact that the EU has powers to exercise in this matter What happened involving the B52 bomber is not the only nuclear activity that has polluted the Thule area Every aspect needs to be looked into and the EU should make sure that the relevant investigations take place If however the report is to have some significance it must not contain factual errors If we adopt a report containing errors all we do is damage our own credibility I have no interest in defending the Danish Government on this matter On the contrary It has treated Mrs Wallis badly and it has been all too slow in forwarding the results of the many investigations to Parliament We nonetheless very much hope that we get the report properly adopted so that it is practical and effective enough subsequently to influence events and is not merely set aside for not having respected the real facts on behalf of the GUENGL Group DA Madam President the plane crash on 21 January 1968 in NorthWestern Greenland triggered not only 850 metrehigh flames but also extensive radioactive pollution The Danish authorities wanted the matter kept under wraps They knew that their tacit acceptance of American aircraft armed with nuclear weapons in Greenlands airspace was unpopular among the populations of both Denmark and Greenland That is why 18 years went by before the authorities began to take an interest in the health of the Greenlanders affected and of the civilian workers involved in the cleanup operation Even today the people concerned have still not been given a complete picture of what happened to them This is partly because successive Danish governments have refused to comply with the provisions of the EURATOM Treaty which they nonetheless signed P In the view of the Confederal Group of the European United LeftNordic Green Left that is the crucial point in Mrs Walliss proposal We are able to support the first four of the five amendments by the Group of the GreensEuropean Free Alliance but we shall in any case vote in favour of the proposal in the final vote on behalf of the INDDEM Group DA Madam President for the first time in 28 years I shall vote tomorrow in favour of criticising my own government in Denmark I am ashamed of the way we behaved towards the few hundred survivors of the American nuclear accident in Greenland in 1968 In order to conceal the fact that this accident was a nuclear one the authorities failed to supply them with personal protection when getting them to clean up after it Many have since died of cancer while animals have been born with defects which can presumably be traced back to the accident Mr Carswell has raised this matter in the Committee on Petitions He has himself been in hospital 50 times due to the effects of the accident Mrs Wallis has done some detailed work for the committee over the last three years involving hearings and visits and now Mrs Auken comes along to the actual sitting at which we are to vote and wants to see all the work begun again from scratch The matter is very simple and is not about the presence or otherwise of radiation What it is about is the fact that under the EURATOM Treaty the survivors are entitled to annual health checks however much their health may or may not have been affected and they are entitled to have access to their own medical reports Denmark should now comply with those two requirements P I should like to thank Mrs Wallis and the committee for the very responsible work they have done on this matter I myself took part in all the meetings and if Mrs Auken had shown her interest when the matter was discussed she would not have tabled amendments at the last minute Imagine if all the other reports from Parliament had to be debated again because Mrs Auken had not taken part in the committee reading I urge you to vote in favour of the report tomorrow without lastminute amendments P The Commission now says that there is a need for a political solution There are some of us who have tried to obtain such a solution I have sent private letters to the Prime Minister in order to get this matter cleared up politically His attitude was sympathetic but no solution was found because officialdom does not want to give way on this matter What a good thing it is then that people have access to a Committee on Petitions to which they can turn when officials are not disposed to listen to them Member of the Commission Madam President honourable Members enforcement of rights could be done on the basis of legislation The Commission has analysed this thoroughly Unfortunately I cannot add anything further even after this very professional debate P At the same time I could also say that the report will be a reference document for future Community action in this field The debate is closed P The vote will take place tomorrow Thursday",

we as Members of the European Parliament have decided to express our solidarity visàvis our Palestinian colleagues imprisoned by Israel Symbolically 45 MEPs demonstrated this support by collectively sponsoring the 45 Palestinian Members of Parliament As elected representatives we cannot but condemn the imprisonment of the President and of one third of the Members of the Palestinian Legislative Council We ask for their immediate and unconditional release We continue to appeal for a European Parliament delegation to be sent and for all the necessary steps to be taken in order to achieve this aim P Applause I must inform the honourable Member that last Wednesday a week ago today I made a similar request to the Knesset Making such a request before the Knesset is something that takes a great deal of prior thought Let us hope that we reach a solution on all the issues including the release of the three captured Israeli soldiers and the BBC journalist Alan Johnston Movement is needed on all sides High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy ES Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to begin by saying that exactly a week ago the Quartet was meeting in Berlin Since I am sure that you will have read the document that was made public that same evening you may be aware of our solidarity with the Members of the Palestinian Authority of the Parliament who have been detained and as the President of this Parliament has quite rightly said with the other people who have been detained against their will in Israeli or Palestinian territories P Mr President I would like to make a brief statement I have been asked to speak for no longer than 10 or 15 minutes I shall try to do so I would like to tell you that I have just returned from a long journey throughout the region and I have been able to meet with the most important regional leaders and to carry out an analysis of the situation so that I could report also to the Quartet which met last Wednesday P I was pleased to make that trip at more or less the same time as the President of Parliament with whom I spoke by telephone and also a distinguished group of MEPs who have written me a letter to which I have not yet replied I would like to meet with them personally because please believe me I have not been in Brussels for a single day since then P I shall see if I can do so so that I can meet with you to talk calmly about the issues that you have raised which I believe to be extremely important P Mr President I believe that this sitting is of particular importance It is also being held on a very important date for Palestine for Israel and for the citizens of the world in general and of the Arab world in particular P It is currently the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of the 1967 war the many tragic consequences of which we are still suffering When we look at the last forty years it undoubtedly sends a shudder right through us P They have been forty years of occupation of suffering on both sides of violence during which the citizens both Palestinians and Israelis have suffered greatly and also forty years during which there have been an excess of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories P Given this fortyyear situation we have two opportunities or ways to look at the situation to look back in order to try to learn lessons regarding mistakes that must not be repeated or to look forward and try to see whether we can learn the most important lesson of all that the only solution to this conflict that has now lasted for forty years is peace A rapid peace process that leads rapidly to peace P There have been many processes many opportunities for peace have been missed I believe that we should now all have the will the will to act not just the will to think and speak but the will to act so that we can truly make peace a reality in those lands that are so dear to many of us and to Europeans in general P I would therefore like to look forward but I must make a brief comment on this journey since the areas that I have visited are all areas which are unfortunately not enjoying the best of times at the moment P In the occupied territories in Palestine we are witnessing a difficult situation with violence amongst Palestinians and also renewed violence between Israel and Palestine The parties appeals for a ceasefire have not been heard either in Palestine or between Palestine and Israel P I would like to send an appeal today to everybody with responsibilities in this area for a ceasefire as soon as possible so that a favourable climate can be created for progressing towards peace P I had the opportunity to visit Gaza So did the President of Parliament Visiting Gaza at the moment is a truly significant experience This is not the first time I have been to Gaza but I believe that going there at this point in particular and meeting with the President of the Palestinian Authority was a moral obligation in order not to give the impression that the world has completely forgotten about what is happening in Gaza Gaza is in a difficult situation with violence between Palestinians violence which will lead nowhere if it continues P The first thing we must do is therefore to try to quell that violence to bring about a ceasefire so that the Palestinians can finally begin to work together for a common cause which is of course peace peace with their neighbours and peace amongst themselves We are doing everything we can in relation to that policy both from my position and from the position of the Commission which is helping generously P I would like to tell you that the situation in Palestine from economic and social points of view is a dramatic one I therefore believe that as soon as this period is over and we can meet again with the political leaders in a clearer and more transparent way we shall have to think about drawing up a special plan of aid for Gaza Otherwise we may be faced with a truly difficult situation in Gaza and it will be difficult to recover for the purposes of a genuine peace process P I would also like to say that I believe that President Abbass solemn appeal yesterday on the anniversary of the beginning of the 1967 war deserves to be read and analysed by everybody because it shows a moral courage that is worthy of note P I would like to say that I was also in Israel I met with the Prime Minister with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I was also in Sderot the area suffering the most Kassam rocket attacks I also felt it appropriate to express our solidarity European solidarity with all of those suffering any kind of violence including Kassam rocket attacks P It was a difficult and tough place to be but in any event experiencing it on the ground gives us a clearer picture of what is happening P In our statement last Wednesday the members of the Quartet called upon Israel to show restraint P Israel is also experiencing a difficult political situation The primary elections in the Labour Party are not yet over they are about to conclude and we shall see what form the next government takes if there are any changes after the elections in the Israeli Labour Party P I would also like to say that the Quartets statement contains a clear and vigorous appeal for Israel to transfer resources to the Palestinian authorities P The international community can do a lot and we are doing a lot in fact We Europeans are probably doing more than anybody P The Arab countries have also started to give money to the Finance Minister Salam Fallad and today we can say that the possibility is beginning to emerge of creating a budget for the Palestinian National Authority P Without the transfer of resources from Israel to Palestine however there is little else the international community can do Improving the economic conditions is essentially linked to a transfer of resources from Israel to the Palestinians P I would like to make a few brief comments on the Quartet and then on Lebanon P I believe that the meeting of the Quartet last Wednesday in Berlin was in my experience and we have belonged to the Quartet for many years since I participated in setting it up surely one of the most important meetings we have held so far It was a Quartet in which we were able to give serious thought to how the peace process can be implemented If you read the final paragraph of the Statement you will see that it truly looks to the future and commits the members of the Quartet to beginning to work hard in cooperation with the parties Israel Palestine and Arab States to initiate a peace process to initiate a process with a political outlook P I would like to inform you that for the first time in its history the Quartet is going to make a joint visit to the region it is going to hold a meeting over the coming weeks with the Palestinians and with the Israelis and it is also going to hold a meeting with the Arab countries who I believe with the Arab peace initiative are also cooperating in the beginnings of a normalisation of life or the beginning of the possibility of normalisation in the territories between Israel and Palestine P I therefore believe that at this time of dejection amongst many people of dejection amongst the Palestinians and also within a certain sector of Israeli society the international community by means of the Quartet is reacting in the opposite manner It is reacting with hope with the sense that after forty years we have the moral obligation to make every possible effort to make progress towards the formalisation of peace towards a peace process P I would like to say to you that these coming weeks are going to be absolutely crucial in terms of setting in train a movement that can take us from the current situation to a peace process that leads to peace P It is not so difficult to identify the elements that can lead this process to peace Almost all of us have a notion of the parameters required in order to achieve peace What we now need to do is to get to work on it in cooperation with all of the members of the Quartet I would like to stress that the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations the US Secretary of State and the Russian Foreign Affairs Minister were very cooperative with regard to our proposal and they expressed clear support for the ideas that it was my privilege to present to the Quartet on Europes behalf P We are therefore at an extremely significant crossroads ladies and gentlemen in terms of the situation on the ground but also a positive crossroads in terms of moving towards a peace process that we can begin to see sketched out on the horizon P Ladies and gentlemen I cannot let this speaking time that the Presidency has allowed me to go by without saying a few words about Lebanon Lebanon is once again in a situation of profound crisis The honourable Members are well aware of this These are moments of profound significance and some of them have been going on for some time From the murder of former Prime Minister Hariri the whole situation that they experienced over the summer the current situation of political paralysis which has become even more serious with the movements that have emerged with acts of terrorism in the refugee camps in two refugee camps specifically one in the north and the other in the south P As you know the Lebanese army has reacted in a way that I would describe as patriotic and the support for the Lebanese army from all of Lebanons political factions has also been patriotic which is truly extraordinary given the differences that have existed amongst them over recent months weeks and days P We also hope and pray that peace will also come to Lebanon and that the special circumstances that have arisen over recent days which were also accompanied by the United Nations Security Councils approval of the International Criminal Court to try the crimes that were committed in Lebanon will make it possible to reach an agreement amongst all of the political forces in order to unblock the political process in Lebanon That is what we want and we are cooperating in the best possible to way in order to see it come about P Mr President I shall remain within the speaking time available to me and I would like to end by reiterating what I said at the beginning we have a moment of hope a moment that we must be able to exploit which in one way or another must complete the circle that was begun forty years ago and which we hope to see completed by means of peace by means of a life lived together by two States Israel and Palestine That peace must include the other countries Syria Lebanon so that we can see the reemergence of a Middle East that can offer more hope to everybody which is prosperous and which makes a constructive contribution to peace throughout the region P We Europeans cannot close our eyes to this task and you may rest assured that mine at least will always be open P Applause Thank you Dr Javier Solana for your statement but also for your untiring work and deep commitment Let me say that my experiences were the same as yours We must not let ourselves be discouraged from continuing along the path of peace Mr President as we all know and as Mr Solana has just said the atmosphere in the region is extremely tense I would even say that there is even a sense of despair My director is still there and he has just called me Unfortunately security has deteriorated and we are witnessing a vicious circle of violence particularly in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in Israel and in Lebanon as Mr Solana has just said P If the causes of this despair are not addressed we may very soon witness the consolidation of more radical groups throughout the region I think this is the great danger there In Lebanon as Mr Solana has just said fighting has now spread to other Palestinian camps We are therefore deeply concerned that the confrontation between the Lebanese armed forces and the Islamist insurgents is there This has turned out to be the most serious internal conflict since the end of the civil war and has already cost over 100 human lives P I would like to stress once again our full support for the legitimate government of Lebanon I would however repeat our position that everything possible has to be done to avoid further casualties among the civilian population The relief agencies must be able to carry out their work P On the other hand I would also like to express my satisfaction with the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1757 which secures the establishment of a special tribunal on the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri I think this will allow the people of Lebanon to affirm respect for the law and the rule of law in their country and to turn a page on one of the most tragic events in Lebanons recent history P The meeting due to take place in Gaza tomorrow between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert has unfortunately been cancelled but at least the leaders of the G8 will tomorrow be tackling the issue of the PalestineIsraeli conflict as we did at the G8 Foreign Ministers meeting There was the greatest concern about the political and security developments both in Gaza and in Israel but also recognition that there is no alternative to continuing this humanitarian support and on the other hand to exploring how to support this Arab peace initiative P Even at this very delicate and difficult time we believe that there is still some reason for hope because the Israeli initiative is a unique opportunity for a comprehensive solution We know that the Egyptians too are trying to broker a ceasefire with all the Palestinian factions US involvement particularly the involvement of Condoleezza Rice is very valuable at this difficult time Our EU Presidency is also very committed The Quartet has done exactly as Mr Solana has said I think it was a very good meeting and the idea is there for both the bilateral track and the regional track Hopefully the meeting can come about in Egypt with Arab League interlocutors and hopefully also with the two parties P Two days ago I spoke to the Jordanian Foreign Minister Mr Abdel Ilah AlKhatib who is planning with his Egyptian counterpart to visit Israel before the Arab League meets with the Quartet at the end of June We hope that this will help to further engage Israel and encourage it to respond positively to the Arab peace initiative P Last week I also attended a conference in Vienna on the role of women leaders as contributors to peace and security in the Middle East Prominent women such as Tzipi Livni Hanan Ashrawi Condoleezza Rice and others discussed the potential contribution of civil society of women in society to peace Even if it is a small contribution this was the first time that Tzipi Livni and Hanan Ashrawi had held discussions at the same table I must say that there was quite a lot of mutual understanding and there was even a friendly atmosphere The initiative proved to be another useful part of this very difficult process I plan to organise some sort of followup meeting in Brussels perhaps next year P We very much appreciate the European Parliaments involvement the visit by the EP Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council was followed by your visit Mr President and by your very balanced speech in the Knesset on 30 May It is encouraging that the speech as you said was quite well received by the Knesset This is not an easy opportunity P The Palestinian people desperately need a political perspective We the members of the Quartet are all clear on that This is why we must press for negotiations on a final status issue cooperating with the structures set up by the Arab League The Arab League asked Israel to free certain measures also related to the occupation for instance the settlements and the separation barrier I was very encouraged by President Abbass call for an immediate end to this internal violence because Qassam rockets from Gaza have to stop once and for all The ceasefire should indeed be extended to the West Bank I very much regret that tomorrows meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas had to be cancelled but we apparently have to realise that the two sides could not reach agreement on Abbass plan for a ceasefire in particular on linking the ceasefire in Gaza with the cessation of military operations in the West Bank No agreement was possible either on unfreezing Palestinian clearance revenues withheld by Israel before the release of the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit We had hoped for some movement on this The Palestinians decided that they could not risk this meeting but of course we had all hoped that this would give a little more progress on the dialogue on the ceasefire progress on the transfer of revenues and on movement of access P Regarding the National Unity Government in my opinion now is certainly not the time to give up on it I can agree that it has not yet delivered everything we were hoping for but there are no attractive alternatives If we allow this Government to crumble the implications for the institutions of the Palestinian Authority are very grave and radical splinter groups may be strengthened as a result I think this is the last result we would want P As you know within the limits set by the Council of Ministers the Commission has responded quickly to the National Unity Government and to the increased needs of the Palestinians In the first half of 2007 alone we committed EUR 320 million of Community funds which almost equals the total amount of funds committed last year This exceptional effort shows that since the formation of the National Unity Government we have stepped up our emergency assistance to the Palestinians But the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority is extremely grave as Salam Fayyad told my colleague yesterday They still need us to go on even with this mechanism Israel must release the withheld clearance revenue to the Palestinian Authority I think we therefore will have to go on encouraging them to do so via the temporary international mechanism or through the PLO account We reiterated this request at the last Association Committee with Israel in Jerusalem on 4 June The Quartet has also noted the importance of the resumption of transfers to improve economic and humanitarian conditions in the West Bank and Gaza As I said movement is of course essential in any case P Since the formation of this National Unity Government we have been working very closely with the Minister of Finance Because the socioeconomic situation is so dire we will extend the TIM until 30 September and we must look for fresh funds for this new extension I will soon ask the European Parliament and the Council to make another effort and to find additional resources in the budget I thank you for whatever you have given as support in the past and do hope that this support will also be extended to us in the future because our priority task should be to help restore the institutions of the Palestinian authority so that it can then deliver services to the Palestinian people We are trying gradually to shift towards a resumption of institutionbuilding and development projects and to decrease our current concentration on emergency and humanitarian aid if we can do so of course this condition is still there P We look forward to new Palestinian proposals They said they would come up with ideas for specific international support The Palestinian Authority is currently preparing an operational plan which could then be a useful tool for identifying development activities particularly in Gaza that we could support P I would also like to say that the financial deficit of the Palestinian Authority is so large that it would be impossible for the Community to shoulder the burden alone Arab States also have to deliver on their commitments to help the National Unity Government I was encouraged to see that the PLO account established now was at least used by Saudi Arabia Qatar and the United Arab Emirates This will help but it is not sufficient P Applause Thank you Commissioner May I also thank you very sincerely Mrs FerreroWaldner for your commitment to this difficult peace process if we can still speak of a peace process on behalf of the PPEDE Group ES Mr President I would like firstly to thank the High Representative for his tireless efforts in the quest for peace and you yourself Mr President for your visit to the region for its symbolism and the solidarity it demonstrated and Commissioner FerreroWaldner for the immense job that the European Commission is doing in the midst of a serious political crisis with the factions making up the Government of National Unity now in confrontation and in the midst of an extremely serious social economic and humanitarian crisis P What can be done in this situation Little more than what Mrs FerreroWaldner and Mr Solana have told us I believe to redouble the European Unions diplomatic efforts and to act on the basis of two premises P The first is a halt to the internal fighting between the two factions making up the Government of National Unity which are waging a vicious battle for power which is having a dramatic effect on the civilian population P Secondly Mr President and we must also state this very clearly a permanent and explicit commitment from the Government of National Unity to democracy and the renunciation of violence P What can we do in the meantime Mr President Commissioner FerreroWaldner has explained it very clearly to try to apply the humanitarian aid mechanism as flexibly as possible to increase the sums allocated to it and to redistribute it amongst the other priorities P Mr President the maximum sentence according to my countrys Penal Code is thirty years and one day Mr Solana reminded us today that it is forty years since the Six Day War which led to the occupation of Gaza the West Bank and the Golan Heights And the situation remains stagnant and bogged down Forty years of suffering and death is more than a society or two societies as Mr Solana pointed out can tolerate P I believe that this Parliament must respond in a united fashion in support of the representatives of the Council and the Commission so that the European Union within the international community in general and the Quartet in particular can do everything possible to bring about as Mr Solana and Mrs FerreroWaldner have said a new opportunity for peace for a society and a region that has already suffered too much on behalf of the PSE Group IT Mr President Mrs FerreroWaldner Mr Solana ladies and gentlemen as has been pointed out this debate is taking place on the 40th anniversary of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza What was supposed to be a lightning strike has turned into a neverending nightmare 40 years is such a long time that entire generations of Palestinians have never known anything but occupation humiliation checkpoints and then the wall and almost total imprisonment Movement is now all but impossible in the occupied territories P Over these 40 years Israel has certainly not found the guarantees of security that it was looking for either and it has experienced worrying erosions of democracy and the rule of law These are two peoples exhausted by endless war and violence For our part we would like to emphasise as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has long been saying quite clearly that the only possible way to inject any form of a constructive approach into a constantly deteriorating situation is to openly support the Palestinian Government of National Unity P We should add to that the commitment that the international community should consider making to send in a peacekeeping force to prevent the violence of recent weeks in Gaza from degenerating even further to reestablish the basic conditions for people to lead normal lives and for international law to be respected and above all to break the vicious circle of endless violence P From Israel we expect gestures other than the murders and indiscriminate arrests that came in response to the Qassam rocket strikes on Sderot The occupation the settlements the wall and the status of Jerusalem are making the prospect of a twoState solution more unlikely every day as even United Nations sources are now saying The United Nations the United States Russia Europe and the entire international community have a responsibility to act before all chances of coexistence are gone for ever P Lastly I would remind you that there is an Arab plan that offers Israel a prospect of peace not only with the Palestinians but with Arab countries as a whole That is something that needs addressing with more conviction Prime Minister Olmert himself said the other day that that plan could provide a basis for negotiations I hope he did not say so just because his government is particularly weak P The situation in Lebanon is equally serious as you have pointed out I believe that the UNIFIL forces on the ground should be supported and reinforced Lastly we should like to call on President Poettering to take steps to call an extraordinary meeting of the EuroMediterranean Parliamentary Assembly on behalf of the ALDE Group NL Mr President High Representative Commissioner ladies and gentlemen around this time we commemorate the SixDay War which on the one hand established Israels military supremacy but which also ushered in the start of the occupation confrontations violence and endless bloodshed that have lasted 40 years Anyone in Israel who was born in the Occupied Territories after June 1967 in other words anyone who is 40 years or younger has known nothing but uncertainty and anxiety about the future of their own country their loved ones and their own lives After 40 years it is really time to say enough is enough Peace should now be brokered as a matter of urgency sustainable peace on the basis that two countries recognise each others right to exist and need to be left alone by their neighbouring countries P All previous speakers have taken great pains to explain how complicated difficult and complex this is but ladies and gentlemen there is one ingredient without which it will never work namely political will and political courage Without the kind of political will and political courage that was evident at one time in South Africa for example in both camps to end apartheid a brutal regime it will not work The unfortunate thing is that nobody can have political will and political courage for the protagonists It is they themselves who will need to muster this political will and this political courage Tomorrow a human chain of Jews and Palestinians will be formed around the Berlaymont building who will all say together After 40 years we have really had enough After 40 years we must work on peace P Sadly though the conflict between Israel and Palestine is not the only one fermenting trouble in the region Fresh violence has flared up in Lebanon in which some see the hand of Syria which wants to avoid an international Hariri tribunal at all costs On behalf of my group I should like to welcome the decision by the UN Security Council which has had the courage to say that such a tribunal will be set up As you know this will be a mixed tribunal involving both international and Lebanese judges and a mixed public prosecution which will function according to the principles of Lebanese law In Lebanon too though political courage will be needed in all camps finally to give the Lebanese what they are entitled to as well peace and security on behalf of the UEN Group Mr President I should like to thank the High Representative and the Commissioner for their presentations here today Rather than speak about all the countries in such a short time I shall concentrate on Palestine because everything that happens in every other part of the Middle East relates to the situation in Israel and Palestine P Looking at the debates that took place at the special session of the UN Security Council 40 years ago in 1967 after the start of the SixDay War it is interesting to see that the potential solution or plan considered was a guarantee of Israeli security and borders based on a withdrawal by Israeli forces from the Occupied Territories and a twostate solution Forty years later the Quartet has failed to deliver on what should be the simplest of all goals to bring people around to this way of thinking P We have made mistakes at European level with our negative reaction to the election of the Hamas Government in Palestine which sent out the wrong signal allowing radical groups to take control on the ground and leading people to say There is no point in voting for these people or bringing these people in because the Europeans will cut off the money That is why it was so important as the Commissioner rightly said that funding was restored through the emergency mechanism P That work must continue because only by building relations and building dialogue between the peoples can we guarantee that there will be a resolution That resolution must be predicated on the same principles as 40 years ago a twostate solution a guarantee of secure borders and justice and equity for all peoples in Israel and in Palestine on behalf of the VertsALE Group ES Israel won the Six Day War but it has lost the peace with forty years of occupation We are now seeing a dangerous tendency towards the Iraqisation and tribalisation of violence in the Middle East P The emergence of Fatah alIslam in the Palestinian camps in Lebanon and the increasing fragmentation of the civil conflicts in Gaza do not bode well for the future of the region P We are seeing the impact of the Palestinian problem spreading throughout the Middle East and becoming mixed up with the interests of the different players P We are running the risk of hitting rock bottom very soon Are we going to wait around doing nothing until the Palestinian Authority collapses As I have said we cannot allow that to happen How can we ensure that it will not Is the chaos and violence of war by everybody against everybody a death foretold P Gaza cannot wait any longer The European Union cannot carry on turning its back on the democraticallyelected Government of National Unity This European policy has contributed to the popular discrediting of any hint of moderation on the part of Hamas and Fatah because it demonstrates that the acceptance of the Mecca Agreement does nothing to change the embargo or improve the terrible living conditions in the huge prison known as Gaza P Firstly the European Union must begin a dialogue with all of the parties including Hamas in order to promote a stable unity government P Secondly we must restore direct financial aid to the Palestinian Authority and ensure that Israel returns the money from Palestinian taxes that it is keeping P Finally we must work to extend the Gaza ceasefire to the West Bank with the creation of international guarantees sending European and Arab troops under a UN mandate to Gaza and if necessary to the West Bank P At the same time we are calling for the release of the fortyfive Members of Parliament and of the Israeli Gilad Shalit and for a halt to the launching of Kassam rockets and Israels devastating responses P Applause from the left on behalf of the GUENGL Group FR Mr President Mr Solana Commissioner my group was very keen to hold this debate particularly today 40 years after the start of a war to which the international community including the European Union has shown itself to this day incapable of imposing the only just and lasting solution that is an end to the occupation to the colonisation to the oppression by Israel of the Palestinian territories conquered in 1967 P Mr President I welcomed in their form and substance the strong words you spoke about this in the Knesset on 30 May I particularly remember three key sentences from your speech You stated that international law is binding on us all You are right We ask no more of Israel than that it should respect the Security Council resolutions the Geneva Conventions the opinions of the International Court of Justice and humanitarian law as the United Nations Organisation UNO has just pointed out The violations of the law are flagrant constant and massive They are in relation to settlements refugees prisoners the wall and primarily of course the occupation of the territories and the annexation of East Jerusalem P You have also pointed out Mr President that I quote a twostate solution on the basis of the 1967 borders is and remains the only way to a satisfactory solution It is a fundamental truth The multiplication of settlements the construction of the wall the isolation of Palestinian areas of Jerusalem however serve precisely to make this solution impossible The Israeli authorities disregard for the Arab Leagues peace plan confirms this strategy of making things worse P You have rightly reminded us Mr President of this obvious fact there is no peace without justice The famous Israeli historian Tom Segev recently echoed the thoughts of those of his compatriots who for 40 years have believed that I quote in 1967 Israel laid the foundations for future terrorism Great men of State such as Yitzhak Rabin understood this but the Israeli peace forces who are a credit to that country are marginalised by the current regime P The conclusion to be drawn from this tragic experience of 40 years of blindness is in the opinion of my group as follows laisser faire amounts to us making ourselves guilty Let us dare to stand up for truth I quote your words one last time Mr President you said let us have the courage to make a new start together P Applause from the left Thank you Francis Wurtz for the reference to what I said before the Knesset Mr President I should very briefly like to reply to the contributions from the honourable Members representing the different political groups in this House P I think that most of the speeches followed a line which is in a sense the same one that we have been defending for a long time namely the time has come to move on from the policy of crisis management which is very important but it is not enough We need policies together with crisis management to solving the conflict We need to work towards a political horizon to really begin to get into the business of solving the conflict that started 40 years ago That is basically the view everybody has expressed and it is something that we will be trying to do in the coming days P I told you that last Wednesday the Quartet met in Berlin and I said that for the first time the Quartet is committed to starting a debate with the parties in order to begin to work towards a political horizon This means that before the end of this month the Quartet will meet with the Palestinians and Israelis in order to push forward the dialogue which is still in its preliminary stages that has begun between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert They are the two people who must find the way towards peace It is our obligation to push and to provide a catalyst for this process That is what we are going to do It is written very clearly in the statement produced by the Quartet last Wednesday I think that this is a profound change and I would like to underline that because someone asked whether we are going wait passively for a catastrophe to arrive The answer is no we do not want to do that you do not want to do that the people in the region do not want to do that Therefore under the leadership of the Quartet we are trying to put forward this mechanism in order to move towards peace P A few other ideas were put forward by some of the honourable Members representing the political groups including the suggestion of an international force I would like to say that for the first time in many years the idea of an international force is not out of the question As you know the idea was brought up in the Knesset by two members of the parliamentary groups saying that this may be the time to call for an international force at least at the beginning in a peacekeeping role or to control the border in the south the socalled Philadelphi Corridor where the Rafah Crossing is situated We are working on that as you probably know because information has already been published The Israelis are also considering that possibility as are the Palestinians The Egyptians are also considering that possibility with different intensity For the Egyptians it would probably be very difficult to have an international force there as it may give the impression that they are not able to control that part of the border However I think that we can still begin discussions on these issues and perhaps eventually reach a solution P This also ties in with what Mrs Napoletano said about the success of UNIFIL The fact that the international force has been responsible for UNIFIL ie for the application of the UN Security Council resolution on Lebanon and the manner in which it has been perceived ie the efficiency of the force of which the backbone is European have also caused some in the Israeli Government the Knesset and Israel as a whole to think that it might be possible for a force of that nature also to be applied elsewhere P In a way we have to link all the issues together It may be possible for us to use what we have learned from our presence in Lebanon in another place That opens the way to a monitoring presence which will be absolutely necessary if we want the peace process to come to fruition P I would like to stress again that as regards Lebanon the resolution creating the tribunal is very important The tribunal is not against anybody There has been a very negative reaction in Syria but I must stress that an international tribunal is not against anybody any country It is a tribunal that is organised in order to see who is responsible for the killing of a good man a friend of many of ours Mr Hariri who was assassinated in a manner that has to be clarified if we want peace and reconciliation in Lebanon Therefore we in the European Union have been working towards this and last Wednesday the Security Council came to another important decision on setting up an international tribunal P I would like to say once again that what we have striven to do in taking the Quartet in the direction that we are now moving is something that has many fathers or many mothers as always but you can be sure that the Europeans have been working very hard from the very beginning to arrive at this moment Let us hope that we are able to continue working in that direction It will be difficult but for the future I hope to have the support help and understanding of the European Parliament as always P Applause Mr President yesterday I met a delegation of Israeli citizens from Sderot who related to me firsthand the terror in their civilian population from 300 random Qassam rocket attacks launched at them from Hamascontrolled sites in Gaza which clearly constitutes a war crime in international law with two dead and many injured to date Last week 33 people were detained by the IDF in the West Bank including the Palestinian Education Minister Nasser alShaer allegedly for their overt support for these rocket attacks The detention of an education minister is interesting as it tends to support the repeated allegations in this House that the Palestinian textbooks and school curriculum supported for years by EU funds are still aimed at fomenting a climate of hatred and distrust for Israel and a glorification of terrorist violence P Many of the Hamas ministerial components of the Unity Government like the Hamas 1988 Charter inspired by Egypts Muslim Brotherhood still believe strongly that the State of Israel has no right to exist that all terrorist violence is justified through socalled armed struggle and that they are not bound by previous PLOsigned international agreements Therefore in my view at present the PA Unity Government clearly does not comply with the Quartet criteria and the EU must not yet lift the ban on Hamas as a designated terrorist organisation or directly fund the PA Government Neither should the TIM be abandoned for the delivery of humanitarian aid which now totals over EUR 500 million yearly and has actually risen over the last three years contrary to popular opinion P I too support the Arab Leagues new proposals for a negotiated solution although the right of return is totally unrealistic But again and curiously Hamas rejects their proposals for Israels recognition Some hardliners on all sides reject peace or a twostate solution but on the 40th anniversary of the sixday war it is clear that this is the only viable longterm solution for a lasting peace in the region But first the PA must ensure law and order on its territory and stop the dissent into virtual HamasFatah civil war in Gaza which is also being stirred up in Lebanon P Once again I would like to call upon the House and the international community to put pressure on all those responsible for the release of the BBC reporter Alan Johnston who we now know is alive and well and the kidnapped soldier Corporal Shalit This will create a climate conducive to restarting the vital roadmap for peace talks FR Mr President at the time of the legislative elections in 2006 I asked a Palestinian Do you think that these elections will bring peace He replied No not peace but democracy And we are going to show the world that even in the occupied territories we are capable of holding free elections P Our response was pathetic Our disregard for the aspirations of a people including their right to make mistakes introduced just a bit more chaos still into a region that is now in ferment The establishment of a National Unity Government and the Mecca Agreement have not sufficiently altered the European Unions hard line or its sanctions Despite your efforts Mrs FerreroWaldner and I appreciate those efforts in spite of what you have said to us and it is encouraging Mr Solana I believe that we have not yet radically changed our policy towards the Middle East and that we have not properly understood that we are damaging the very notion of democracy with our response to these elections P It is an attitude that has persisted for 40 years I believe that we are partly responsible for having allowed for 40 years a situation of total lawlessness to take hold in Palestine with extrajudicial executions theft of land kidnapping now of legitimately elected representatives and ministers the existence of a wall considered illegal by the Court in The Hague and the Geneva Conventions flouted Francis Wurtz spoke about it more than 400 children still held in Israeli prisons more than 400 young Palestinians The United Nations Organisation UNO resolutions ignored the sealing off of territories and restrictions on movements And what else P Of course Mr Tannock we condemn violence we condemn the firing of rockets we condemn the kidnapping of the soldier Shalit but there is at present an imbalance Look at the figures They are alas dramatically unfavourable to the Palestinian people and I repeat there is no equidistance International law that is not equidistance P Nothing today justifies our silence and I should like to salute here these new Just Men those Jews who in Israel and elsewhere speak out and say That must be stopped They say it amid the sniggering the sarcasm and sometimes the threats of their fellow citizens I see myself as a supporter of all those people as I see myself as a supporter of our Palestinian colleagues who regardless of parliamentary immunity have been imprisoned P I should like to say to you that in Belgium all the leaders of the political parties are to meet tomorrow at 1 pm at Berlaymont to make a chain for peace and to ask the European Union to take on its responsibilities not only humanitarian responsibilities but real political responsibilities which are a credit to the European Union DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen none of us questions Israels right to exist We are aware of our political responsibility At the same time I would like to remind the House of the message from a peace conference held in Palestine in the last few days Women who are after all part of civil society Palestinian and Israeli women delivered a clear message to us You speak they said of the coexistence of two states That is good but please take note that our existence is threatened in Palestine and in Gaza P I believe that the crux of the matter at this time is the existence issue For this reason I am glad that Javier Solana said we had to consider whether we should not review the Lebanon experience as quickly as possible and possibly become involved in Gaza We must act before the situation slides completely out of control because there will not be many more opportunities What you described as courage Dr Solana namely the hope we must have if we are to remain committed and explain our commitment to the people on the ground too that hope has faded to a shadow in the region itself P I wish to thank Mr Poettering on behalf of my group for having made that journey You said that the situation in Gaza is intolerable It is our duty to become more heavily committed than ever before to the right of people there to live in peace and of course that also means criticising Hamas for its duplicity The statement made by Hamas to mark the 40th anniversary of the SixDay War is unacceptable in our view At the same time however we must cooperate actively with the Government of National Unity We shall not get a second chance I second the criticism voiced by Mrs De Keyser just a few moments ago We in the European Union have indeed made mistakes in that region We have bitterly disappointed peoples hopes and have failed to harness their willingness to look to the future P I hope that the Middle East Quartet is now roused from slumber I hope it will go into action and I hope there will be trips to the region It may be a last chance before we can no longer speak realistically of any hope of peace Mr President I would like to begin with some quotes On 2 April Prime Minister Haniyeh said on AlJazeera As far as we are concerned the issue of recognition of Israel has been settled once and for all It has been settled in our political literature in our Islamic thought and in our Jihadist culture on which we base our moves We will declare a truce but never recognition of Israel On AlJazeera on 27 April he said If the siege continues beyond a certain time we will be forced to make a decision and there is no doubt that we will act On 5 May in a prayer he said I reiterate on behalf of the Palestinian Government that the security plan will not hurt the resistance We will give Allah the opportunity to grant us one of the two mercies victory or martyrdom P As a fluent speaker of Arabic I can assure you that the translation is correct The situation is grave We face not only the Iraqisation of Gaza but the Iranisation of the whole Middle East This is not just a threat to the Middle East This is a serious threat to our own security Europe must be a player and we must be absolutely unified Therefore Parliament should remain unified supporting the Council the Commission and the Quartet The Temporary International Mechanism must go on We have to continue humanitarian aid We may even use the PLO account P However the key issue is to bring the Palestinian National Unity Government to renounce violence to recognise Israel and to honour international agreements Only then can we return to UN Resolution 242 clearly asking Israel to withdraw from territories so that there are no deterritories or occupied territories I therefore ask the Council and the Commission whether they consider that the preconditions for the recognition and direct financing of the Palestinian National Unity Government have been met FR Mr President Commissioner Mr Solana when 40 years have passed since the Six Day War and the nations of the Middle East are still suffering now from its tragic consequences when reports by Amnesty International and the United Nations now seriously question the viability of a Palestinian state because of the persistent Israeli policies of occupation and colonisation when unbearable misery is rife in Gaza and on the West Bank feeding the fire between rival Palestinian factions and the National Unity Government the last rampart against civil war is hanging by a thread when the whole region is in ferment from Iraq to Lebanon we can say that compassionate speeches are no longer enough and it is urgent to bring about change an upheaval a revolution dare I say in our Middle East policy and to take on the full extent of our responsibilities P First of all by recognising the Palestinian National Unity Government on which we have pinned our hopes and which has declared willingness to respect all of the UN and PLO resolutions all of the previous resolutions as well as the demands of the Quartet to restore credibility to the twostate solution Next by reinstating our direct aid to this government because it is unrealistic to count on the Israelis to release the tax revenues that were collected by right and which remain confiscated and because the temporary mechanism has fizzled out Furthermore by deploying an international interposition force at the border between Gaza and Israel the only measure that is likely to bring about a ceasefire the effectiveness and endurance of which have been demonstrated in Lebanon Finally and above all by showing considerable ambition perhaps by taking the initiative for a European Camp David that has become necessary since the roadmap brandished by the Quartet comes down to nothing more than a pious hope P Since 1967 we have lost our way in mistakes and injustices Do we have to wait another 40 years P The President cut off the speaker DA Thank you Mr President and thanks also to the Commissioner and the High Representative Simply put however I have my doubts We in the Group of the GreensEuropean Free Alliance have attempted to discuss amongst ourselves what it is we have learnt here It is a top priority for us that we now recognise the Palestinian Government and that action be taken again I am quite simply unable to tell whether that is what we have been told is to happen It was not what Mr Solana told us but was it what Mrs FerreroWaldner said That is did she say that we would now grant recognition and go on from there It seems to me that we need a clear answer to this question because what frustrates the whole system is the fact that all we get is endless talk and no action The double standards and the paralysis of action are on the point of wrecking not only the Middle East but also the EU P The other matter about which we need clarity is what is meant by the fact that we are now to support the Arab initiative I was unable to conclude from Mr Solanas presentation that this is actually what we intend to do All I could make out was that it was said that we must now engage again in negotiation We are well aware however of where we need to go It is a difficult process to turn this into a reality but we know what has to be brought about and we cannot allow ourselves to become notorious for mentioning the Arab initiative over and over and then letting all the steam out of it by saying now let us see what happens We need to say that this is the point at which we are making a start We have set out before us the final result that we are all well aware is the only acceptable outcome if we are to make progress and that to top it all is what both the West and Israel have long been calling for It has suddenly been put on the table Can we not have clear answers That would be nice DE Mr President Commissioner High Representative the fact that the Quartet now intends to act jointly in the region is good news That is an important message because as we have often said in this House it is only through concerted action that the Quartet acquires the credibility it needs to be able to give all parties the essential security guarantees In the eyes of the region no member of the Quartet can do that on its own May I congratulate you on this development and also on the fact that it can be combined with the Arab initiative P If we want to advance and we have discussed this so often and avoid giving in to hopelessness and despair we must be clear about one thing the moderates on both sides must be able to create conditions in their own territories in which the foundations can be built for a peace process that will not be demolished by the provocations of the extremist minorities on the other side This must therefore be the starting point It is true of course that Israel must release the money It is also true that this patchwork situation in the West Bank with checks and settlements everywhere which nips any economic development in the bud must be ended and that conditions must prevail in which economic development is possible again We can pump as much money into the West Bank as we like but the right conditions simply must be created there P It must also be said however that what is happening in Gaza is a civil war between Palestinians The answer is not an international force deployed between Israel and Gaza but meetings between the warring factions to bring about a satisfactory end to the conflict All of these issues are plainly interconnected but please let us remember that everyone is responsible for his own domain We cannot take over this responsibility Accordingly we must demand an end to the civil war Anyone trying to resolve conflicts between the rival groups by military means is destroying the future prospects of his own people For this reason we must take care to seek our starting points here and thus create a platform from which the Quartet can operate successfully and give us a genuine chance of progress Mr President sometimes I get very dispirited when listening to the debates in this House on this issue particularly when I hear Mr Tannock and Mrs Hybášková who seem intent on laying down conditions in this House for a solution in the Middle East It is not for us to set preconditions for the Israelis and the Palestinians in terms of how they will address each other in the peace negotiations The only preconditions necessary for successful peace negotiations are a demonstrable commitment to peace on each side a mandate to negotiate on each side and the capacity to deliver on the commitments made in the negotiations All other preconditions which MEPs in this House seek to apply to Israelis and Palestinians are so much hot air They have no effect and there is no possible likelihood that they will be met in a situation in which the Palestinian Authority in particular is at the point of collapse If that Authority that Unity Government collapses then nothing we say and nothing the European Union does will prevent the appalling bloodbath that will follow for the Israelis and for the Palestinians P The role of the international community is to ensure that the patrons of each side in this conflict the Quartet and the Arab States set aside their immediate shortterm interests and put the interests of the Palestinians and the Israelis first We must seek to ensure that they come to the table and address the outlines that are already there and which have been for some time as regards the possibilities and conditions for peace It is time we stopped talking and started to act in the interests P The President cut the speaker off SK As Mr Solana and Commissioner FerreroWaldner have told us the situation in the Middle East is indeed critical The situation is critical in Lebanon and it continues to be critical in PalestinianIsraeli relations P The very notion of critical however is dramatic since it implies a situation of financial economic and social decline accompanied by terror attacks and activities kidnappings and the death of civilians The mounting resistance and attacks against the state of Israel and her citizens breed fear and concern resulting in measures which we find incomprehensible The region is a mess conflict is intensifying and the ceasefire is not being abided by The meeting of the Quartet last week pointed out that our active involvement in the peace process was essential However the degree of frustration on either side be it Palestinian or Israeli is just as great as our endeavours to further the peace process P It is imperative therefore to beef up our diplomatic efforts to make them more dynamic and in particular to make them balanced Our activities should not generate the impression that we stand on one side of the conflict It is our duty to demand that Israel release the funds by the same token it is our duty to ensure that the funds are indeed invested in economic and social development It is also our duty to guarantee for the citizens of Israel basic protection of their lives and the basic defence of their state PT This issue of the Middle East and in particular the tragic situation in Palestine has resurfaced several times in recent plenary sessions This should come as no surprise We have all seen on the ground what goes on there We have all seen the same thing we have come to Parliament and reported a terrible and explosive humanitarian situation We have all seen Israels illegal retention of some EUR 700 million in taxes money that does not belong to Israel and that is generating interest by the day We have all seen in the eyes of those people human beings with the right to justice and dignity just like us the hope for a future in which they can live in peace This is a hope that remains alive despite the constraints a hope that every day is severely put to the test by a lack of mobility and by the wall This is a wall that puts paid to any kind of local economy either in its purest meaning of subsistence through farming or in terms of something more ambitious like having enough produce to run a small shop P In the face of the continuous erosion of that hope despair takes hold and as members of this privileged club of countries that won peace after enduring the bitter taste of war we must not think that we can solve problems by throwing money at them Helping the Palestinian people is very important crucial in fact Much more important though is helping them realise that their voice makes a difference in their country and that the credible manner in which they ran their elections and sought a solution to present to the world counted for something Authority must be restored to the Palestinian territories P Let us hope that Finance Minister Salam Fayad can become one of the main spokesmen on matters of financial help to the people It is therefore vital to normalise institutional relations We must demonstrate that we are actually prepared to resolve the conflict We Europeans have a vital part to play in bringing peace to the region and to the world P The President cut off the speaker Mr President we must give peace a chance in the Middle East We know how difficult it is and we all know about the challenges but we all know about the new hopes and we have clearly explained the situation P What is necessary is on the one hand to achieve a certain level of security and a better security situation first to the Palestinians within Gaza but also in the West Bank That is very true Both we and Americans are working with the Palestinians to come to such a solution but unfortunately we are not yet completely there P Second there needs to be greater economic freedom in order to improve the daily lives of the Palestinians This is also what we are trying to do We also said very clearly that we want to engage with this national Unity Government according to the actions and the programme Salam Fayyad is therefore our preferred interlocutor to see what else can be done I have very clearly said what could be done P I would like to repeat to you that in addition to from our continuous work with the temporary international mechanism that I would have liked to phase out as soon as possible but I cannot do so because there humanitarian assistance is still necessary we offered Salam Fayyad technical assistance in the area of audit revenue collection and customs We are currently working with the Ministry to define the delivery of assistance but we are also resuming institutionbuilding where it is important P We are trying to go for development assistance in order to give more hope to the population but it is true that a lot of political courage and political will is necessary first and foremost on the part of the parties to the conflict we members of the Quartet can only support them we can push them we can encourage them and this is what we are trying to do but we cannot unfortunately take the decision for them That is the limit of our action I hope that the next meeting in the region will be a positive one and will be the trigger to this political vision and political horizon that we all have so much in our minds P We hope and plead for the release of all the political prisoners That means the abducted Israeli soldier and the BBC journalist Alan Johnston but also all the members of the Palestinian government and all the others that are still imprisoned I think this would be very good momentum that could be brought about in order to find the next steps towards this twostate solution that we all so clearly wish for Mr President I am not going to repeat what I and others who have contributed to the debate have already said P I would first of all like to thank all the Members of Parliament who contributed those who are still here and those who have left I think it has been a very interesting debate and I would like to make an observation on it When I come to the European Parliament to discuss the Middle East I have the feeling that emotions run high starting with my own But I think that our debates have to be about the events which are important at a given time P Today we are in a very difficult situation but at the same time as has been said it is a time of hope which did not exist for a long time I have been involved in the Middle East for many years I was at the Madrid Conference and at the last Conference at Camp David Not since Camp David have I perceived us to be any closer than I feel we are today to the beginning of real meaningful communication and exchange and therefore the beginning of a political horizon and a debate and negotiations about that There are three reasons for this P One is that the Arab League Initiative is something that was missing at the time of Camp David We have it today and we have the engagement of the Arabs to embrace whoever the Palestinian negotiator is going to be in order to sustain him and to give the support which as you know was not there at the time of Camp David P Secondly 40 years have elapsed I think everybody is exhausted psychologically physically and politically Out of this exhaustion I think that we have to muster new psychological and political energy in order to move forward P Thirdly we have a mechanism the Quartet and sometimes we do not realise how much effort goes into that For the first time we have the United States and the European Union at the same table negotiating with the parties which has never happened before We have to recognise that This is the first time that the European Union has been at the negotiating table The Russian Federation was in Madrid and then disappeared There was also the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations imagine for a moment what that means the United Nations negotiated in this conflict It was impossible to imagine at that time P I believe that to a certain extent all these elements change the horizon of what can be done now We must now try to move on try not to falter and try to continue working in that direction Conditions have changed and therefore we have more hope that it can be achieved Will it be achieved in 24 hours No If you think that we will find the solution to all the problems by the end of this month you are wrong we will have to wait a bit longer than that But let us see whether we have the opportunity to move the process forward P As a final thought I would like to stress that we are Europeans here Everyone here is a member of the European Union Sometimes we have to be a little proud of what we do If you go to Palestine as you do you hear the criticism But probably if you really talk in depth to the Palestinians and Israelis you will find a growing sympathy and understanding you have to agree with me about that for the way in which Europeans are doing things I think that we Europeans have to recognise that every now and then Otherwise we will never move forward collectively as we need to do P Moving this process forward is not an effort for one or two it is an effort for everybody We have an opportunity Let us see whether next time we meet we see progress We will not see the solution but let us see whether we make progress The debate is closed P The vote will take place during the next partsession in Strasbourg P Written statements Article 142 in writing PT This week marks the 40th anniversary of Israels illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories of the West Bank the now violently under siege Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem the Syrian territories of the Golan Heights and the Egyptian territories of the Sinai Peninsula which Egypt has since recovered P 40 years of P violations of international law and noncompliance with countless UN Security Council resolutions by the Israeli authorities P criminal and brutal occupation colonisation and repression and denial of the Palestinian peoples legitimate rights by the Israeli authorities P oppression plundering exploitation unemployment and poverty the imposition of the most degrading humiliation and inhuman living conditions on the Palestinian people by the Israeli authorities P actual support and collaboration or at least connivance and tacit acceptance by the USA and its allies in Europe in the face of the Israeli authorities considerable responsibility P June 2007 is a time to reiterate the call for an end to the occupation of the territories that Israel occupied in 1967 for compliance with international law and for the implementation of the relevant UN resolutions such as the Palestinian peoples inalienable right to a viable sovereign and independent State in writing FI Mr President the Six Day War took place in 1967 and it had its winner In the last 40 years the loser has been human dignity The humanitarian crisis in the Middle East is one of the most tragic in recent history There is a vicious circle of violence in the region which no one has yet been able to break Generations of Israelis and Palestinians have lived with instability violence and war P Crisis management has been the tool used in practice to seek a solution to the Middle East conflict Step by step the aim has been a move towards permanent peace A ceasefire has been reached which will soon have collapsed and a new conflict begun P It is difficult to believe in a successful path as long as the parties fail to understand that each act of violence destroys the future of a section of its own people There is also a lack of comprehension among the Palestinian groups There is a civil war going on in Gaza Scores of Palestinians have died in clashes between Fatah and Hamas P Israels military actions and human rights violations are to be condemned Each country must comply with international obligations and international law and should respect human dignity something that can never be surrendered We cannot demand Israels immediate withdrawal from the Palestinian territories however as long as the Palestinian authorities do not recognise the state of Israel P The Quartet the United States of America the United Nations the EU and Russia must obviously continue with their efforts to achieve a lasting peace Parliaments job is to demonstrate European consistency and support the Commission and the Council P There is one thing we surely cannot do we cannot make the parties accept our desire to achieve a lasting peace We can encourage and put pressure on them but we cannot force our will upon them",

    "input": "Definition description presentation and labelling of spirit drinks debate The next item is the report by Horst Schnellhardt on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the definition description presentation and labelling of spirit drinks C604402005 Mr President honourable Members I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Commissioner Fischer Boel who wishes to thank the rapporteur Mr Schnellhardt and the members of the various committees involved in drawing up this excellent report She also wishes to express her appreciation for the good cooperation between all involved in Parliament and the Council and to thank the Council for its work As a result of this cooperation the work has moved smoothly and steadily towards achieving the result of which we are all aware P On 15 December 2005 the Commission submitted a proposal for a new regulation on the definition description presentation and labelling of spirit drinks Since then a whole series of discussions have taken place a public hearing took place in Parliament on 20 July 2006 there were reports from the Committee responsible the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety there were opinions from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection This process has been very intensive and constructive under the codecision procedure A series of informal trialogues took place which led to the Councils general approach which not only accommodates most of the Member States concerns but also reflects the European Parliaments powers of codecision by taking the vast majority of its proposals on board P One proposal in particular that has been taken on board is the abolition of the initial proposal for the categorisation of spirit drinks secondly the introduction of a strong quality policy for spirit drinks thirdly the withdrawal of the proposal to allow flavours to be added to eau de vie and fourthly the strengthening of the powers of the European Parliament by introducing the regulatory committee with scrutiny procedures in most of the cases for which provision is made for comitology Those are just a few of the essential amendments which were introduced on the initiative of the European Parliament During this whole procedure my colleague Commissioner Fischer Boel has played a constructive and pragmatic role with a view to finding a result that we hope the European Parliament will be able to endorse P In line with the international obligations deriving from the TBT Agreement and following the Councils request of 23 April 2007 the Commission sent the file to the WTO setting a twomonth period for comments This notification was formally made on 1 June 2007 P As regards vodka the Commission still has some reservations at this stage which are primarily of a legal nature The Commission has always taken a clear stance that it must ensure that a definition of vodka is compatible with EU law and fits the WTO context The definition of the rawmaterial bases for this popular product which is enjoying considerable market buoyancy worldwide has been subject to considerable debate in the last month The general approach of the Council distinguishes the labelling of vodka between one group based on potatoes and cereals and those products which are derived from other raw materials which shall bear the indication produced from and list the products that go into it The Commissions legal service has expressed concern about the compatibility of this solution both with EU law and with WTO obligations P Any restriction of the present legislation needs to be duly justified and proportionate the least intrusive way has to be found to serve this goal So my colleague would like to conclude with these words For the time being let me congratulate the Council Presidency and Parliament for their very successful collaboration which I hope will be endorsed as a firstreading agreement by Parliament in view of a final adoption once the WTO notification procedure has been brought to an end in two months time rapporteur DE Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen you all heard what the Commissioner said which I can honestly say expressed my feelings exactly All of us in this room heard it and we shall take it into account during tomorrows vote too P What was the starting point When we held the hearing on 26 June of last year we soon found that there were very great differences in the implementation of the Regulation The Council was divided Parliament was divided and we really wondered how all this was to be overcome I regard the fact that we have before us today a compromise involving the Council the Commission and sections of Parliament after first reading mark you as rather sensational considering the starting situation It is a result for all those involved and so I should like to thank the Commission the Council and those fellow Members who have helped to work on it Mrs McAvan Mr Schlyter and Mr Maaten of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to name but a few Their cooperation was excellent and indeed this is the only way of achieving a positive result P Not only did this come together at the drawing board it was also the result of a clear vote in committee 58 votes in favour to only 2 against with 2 abstentions that was a result we could build on As the Commissioner said many of Parliaments proposals have been implemented We already agreed back then that the quality of the Regulation had to be improved it had to include more consumer information and it had to be brought into line with the internal market This Regulation was necessary There had been two regulations and many Acts of Accession but they could not achieve all this P How wonderful there is no system of categories We are not classifying spirit drinks according to quality that would have been a very bad thing but in the field of quality we do have a ban on flavouring spirits This means that it is forbidden to add flavourings to spirits I once said exaggerating somewhat that I wanted to see spirit drinks falling under the Regulation on spirit drinks not containing so many chemicals that they ended up under the Regulation on chemicals What is important however is the protection of producers who use proper methods and we cannot allow to exaggerate the production of spirit drinks to become the preparation of toxic cocktails P The issue of sweetening is another that was pushed through by Parliament I should like to say to the Commission now that when we discuss sweetening under the extended comitology procedure we shall take great care that the addition of sugar is kept within reasonable bounds Figures have been mentioned 20 grams per litre which corresponds to five teaspoons I have to say that tea with five teaspoons of sugar added starts to lose its appeal We shall keep an eye on this P The methanol content of 50 grams per hectolitre in the old Regulation has been reduced to 10 grams per hectolitre This had been a health problem The hydrocyanic acid content of stonefruit marc spirit has been reduced by 3 grams to 7 grams per hectolitre of pure alcohol These are achievements that cannot be praised enough The new proposal also reflects traditional methods We have been at pains to ensure in particular that traditionally produced products can continue to be produced That is a very important point P Moving on now to vodka a very contentious issue I could have lived with the Commission proposal that the rawmaterial basis of vodka always be included on the label but the traditional producing countries for example Poland and Finland objected I took account of these objections which related to traditions and said in that case we shall exempt potatoes and cereals from the labelling requirement and only the other agricultural raw materials used to produce vodka must be stated That was the right solution as when I look at the amendments that have been tabled and hear what the Commissioner has to say I can already tell that all the amendments stating otherwise will fail to gain any support from within the Council the Commission or the WTO We are right to exempt these two products from the labelling requirement in order to take account of traditions in Poland and Finland We must not be tempted to introduce legislative amendments banning the manufacture of products when there is no basis for this in either health considerations or internalmarket rules or consumerprotection rules That would be taking things too far We have always done things that way in previous legislation too P Therefore I would appeal to you to support the compromise tomorrow There is no alternative compromise Failure to adopt the present proposal will render all the other parts of the compromise invalid The Commission will then try again to enforce its ideas which were strongly contested the Council will start quarrelling again and we shall have no regulation for the coming years I should like to point that out so that no one tries to say later on that they would have voted differently if I had only told them that That is the reason for my request I look forward to the discussion draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Mr President I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his patience above all else P The spirit industry is extremely important to us creating jobs status export and tax revenue Therefore it has been important to update the 19891990 regulations to bring greater clarity and greater legal certainty to improve the definition of the main spirit drinks and to resolve any problems with spirits with a quasigeographical indication status P What we now have is a proper registration system for geographical indication which is important and I am glad we have got rid of the three categories of spirits We have now ended up with something that is compatible with the WTO and TRIPS which ensures smooth running in the internal market prevents fraud and counterfeiting protects the consumer and does not underplay and undermine solid longestablished industries such as the second biggest vodka producer in Europe the United Kingdom where in Scotland vodka is such an important industry That is why we must support these proposals P I think the Commission proposal was better than the compromise but it is important to move forward with the compromise on vodka bearing in mind geographical indications will protect forever Polish vodka Finnish vodka Swedish vodka Lithuanian vodka and so on on behalf of the PPEDE Group NL Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen if we have to take decisions about food legislation and end up encroaching on territory which people and Member States believe to form part of their own individuality and tradition then it has never been easy to reach sound agreements The fact that Mr Schnellhardt has managed to do exactly that for this regulation on spirit drinks deserves the respect of us all P We need a fresh regulation because the present one is no longer up to date technologically speaking and because it requires clarification in the area of the WTO rules and also further to the recent enlargement P Mr Schnellhardt has achieved a widely supported agreement in this House and with the Council which will bring us better consumer protection allow our European products to occupy a clearly defined position on the global market within the WTO framework and also promote the smooth running of the internal market Moreover and this is not insignificant it recognises by means of labelling and the system of geographical designations among other things the specificity of each product although there are still doubts among some not least in our group about the vodka provisions Here too though the rapporteur has done a sterling job by requiring that if vodka is made from raw materials other than grain or potatoes this raw material should be indicated on the label next to the product name In doing so we are using techniques that have been used before with great success Years ago in relation to beer and chocolate we held a similar discussion on traditions values interests of suppliers of raw materials and of large and small producers when those discussions were over we reached a compromise much like Mr Schnellhardts present compromise with the Council This is why I would urge all those doubting Thomases among you to revisit the compromise and to give it your backing if possible on behalf of the PSE Group Mr President the Socialist Group will be supporting the trialogue compromise and all its elements as outlined by the rapporteur Mr Schnellhardt I should like to thank him for all his hard work and like Mr Titley his patience because this has become a very complex dossier and one on which emotions have started to run high P We are supporting this compromise because we want the European drinks industry to have highquality products for consumers and we want to protect our industry on the world markets What we do not want to do with this legislation is to give one countrys type of production an advantage over another countrys type of production That is not the aim of the legislation There is room for all European producers as long as they meet high quality standards P That brings me to the vodka compromise I think it is a good compromise Why Because as Mr Schnellhardt has said for the first time it recognises that there is a special place for traditional manufacturers using cereals and potatoes But at the same time it allows other longstanding producers of vodka to continue to market their products on the European market and they will be labelled P We cannot have a situation as proposed by some of the amendments which seek to take certain European producers off the market That would never get a majority in this House and would never get a majority in the Council Everybody has to work in a spirit of compromise and what we have got on the table has something for everybody P We have also got to work with facts It is simply not true that the compromise on vodka would allow you to make vodka for example from animal waste as has been circulated again in this House today That is not true It is made from very highquality agricultural products P I want to say something to the British Conservatives about vodka I understand from their press release last week they are not supporting the compromise now and they have accused Labour of selling the British vodka industry down the river I have to say that this is vital for European jobs it is vital for the drinks industry which employs 60 000 people and has the support of British industry as well as European vodka producers and other drinks manufacturers I can see surprise from some Members I hope we will have this clarified because I have the press release here P Finally it is not just about vodka it is about highquality drinks Many colleagues from different countries have come to Mr Schnellhardt myself and other colleagues and asked for certain changes because of their traditional production All those things have been met The Council and the Commission have been very helpful and I very much hope that tomorrow after as Mr Titley has said 18 years have passed since we started trying to get this legislation on the statute book we just go ahead and do it and protect European jobs on behalf of the ALDE Group NL Mr President the discussion on the Schnellhardt report is being hijacked by the discussion on vodka which is unfortunate because it is a report that says so much more in many areas that are so crucial to Europe and to this industry in Europe This is why I should like to single out a number of those other points P The directives first concern is of course the quality of the European drinks industry It also says something about Europe because wherever you go in the world we see European drinks distilled in Europe available in all shapes and sizes and with a recognition of the quality which we produce in Europe This is important in a situation in which not everything that is said about Europe is always positive because this is something in which Europe excels What the rapporteur has done is to reinforce this very element more so it has to be said in his original report than in the compromise which was eventually struck with the Council It is to my mind a fantastic achievement and something we should hold onto P Distillation is a craft a truly traditional craft Anyone who visits distilleries and I recently visited some gin distilleries in my own country can see for themselves that it is a craft It is an art to make these products well and in a way that the quality is retained at all times This is without a doubt the most important element in this report Rather than adding sugar or flavourings at random we have clear definitions for these drinks even very strict definitions not least at the industrys request This is how consumers receive sound information about the product They know what they buy and can rely on the fact that what they are getting is quality This directive also allows the European drinks industry thanks to this quality to remain a strong contender in the competition P It also says something about Europe namely about the regional origin of many of these drinks In this respect this directive is almost like a microcosm of the European Union as it demonstrates the diversity of the European Union and how we together in this very diversity can all still be European This too is very important to my mind P I will now briefly turn to the subject of vodka on which the rapporteur has tried to reach a compromise which received my wholehearted support during the discussion He has as I see it made a valiant attempt at trying to strike a sound compromise between the old vodka industries in the European Union which existed at the time the definition was drafted even before Sweden Finland Poland and all the other countries joined the Union and these more recent Member States and has done a reasonable job of it P Despite this most of my group are in favour of a much stricter definition of vodka and I have to say that their arguments are valid This is why it is good that this issue is on the table so that it can be thrashed out Firstly as regards consumer information my group takes the view that every consumer must be able to rely on the fact that vodka is made from potatoes or cereals these are of the essence and sugar beet perhaps As the majority in my group see it consumers should be able to take this as read P It goes further than this though This is not just about the product There is also a discussion about the individuality and identity of the countries where it is produced After all what would our reaction have been if this discussion with these countries had been held before Would we have said for the sake of consumer information it is also possible to introduce onto the market cognac made from potatoes or whiskey made from grapes No of course we would never have done this and my group wants us to be consistent in the case of vodka too They have a point of course P I would like to see us reach agreement at first reading I welcome the fact that this argument is on the table and in this respect I support my groups amendment on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President objections have been raised concerning the proposal for a regulation on spirit drinks for a number of reasons P First of all broadening the definition of vodka to include spirit drinks based on raw ingredients other than those traditionally used infringes the law and is damaging to the economic interests of current vodka producers and consumers P Secondly as a result of the proposed changes the new Member States will yet again lose out Poland one of the main vodka producers in the European Union and the world will be particularly affected P Thirdly this move will be yet another blow for farmers who grow cereal crops potatoes and beet They will not have the slightest chance of compensating for their losses with other crops P Fourthly the name vodka is a trade name linked with a specific product that is manufactured according to a specific recipe and using specific ingredients namely grain potatoes and beet molasses Any product made from other raw ingredients will be a different product Therefore it cannot be labelled as vodka It has to have its own distinct name on behalf of the VertsALE Group SV Mr President I wish above all to thank Mr Schnellhardt for the piece of work that we now have and that demanded so much patience What patience we have all shown towards the lobbyists of the spirits industry It will be a great relief to be rid of them P This package is really all about we politicians regulating sales advantages through origin marking and similar measures That being said I nonetheless think that even when it comes to spirits which are not in themselves useful products that politicians should encourage origin marking and similar measures may have a large role to play in defending local patterns of production against unfair competition P What I think we have so far forgotten to talk about in the debate is the work we have done to reduce the sugar content of spirits and the use of synthetic flavourings and colorants That is also an important aim of the compromise to produce a smaller quantity of synthetic spirits P We now move on to vodka Incidentally I have tabled an amendment number 149 designed to stop all traditionally unsweetened types of spirit from being sweetened Let us return to vodka however The compromise arrived at states that grain and potatoes are the basis for vodka and that the product should be labelled accordingly if it is made of anything else If producers begin to cheat where labelling is concerned and try to evade the issue and sell nontraditional vodka as ordinary vodka we shall have to come back to this issue as it is not intended that they should do that If vodka is made of anything other than grain or potatoes this must be stated on the bottle P Sugar beet has been added in the amendments designed to afford still more protection to vodka It is not traditional in my country to make vodka from sugar beet Why should I support amendments that add sugar beet and put it on a par with grain and potatoes I am therefore voting against those amendments on behalf of the GUENGL Group CS Ladies and gentlemen I should first like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his sterling efforts in drawing up this report I feel that he was able despite initial difficulties to strike a balance and reach a compromise in terms both of technology and of the various national interests I should like to highlight two points the first of which is the definition of vodka P In our proceedings in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety I have already said that we should not succumb to the pressure that has been brought to bear by the socalled traditional producers It is my firm belief that the argument so often put forward that we should have the same precise definition of what raw materials vodka can be made from as we do for whiskey and rum is not entirely valid After all the technology of vodkamaking is completely different I therefore feel that the current definition of vodka is workable and sufficient With regard to the current situation and to the opinions of the traditional producers I feel that the compromise definition in point 145 of the report could be a solution and as shadow rapporteur I recommend that at least some MEPs from my group should support it P I cannot finish without mentioning the definition of slivovice a specific issue for the Czech Republic Mr Schnellhardt knows that there was a technical oversight and that the Committee on the Environment P The President cut off the speaker on behalf of the INDDEM Group NL Mr President I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on the compromise that is before us It has been some time coming but with this result there is a good chance of an agreement at first reading P I am delighted that the point that I have mentioned during the debate in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety has been accepted It concerns the ambiguous clause of creating the impression that there is mention of a certain age on the label I am pleased that this clause has now been scrapped because in this way the Dutch young gin and old gin remain safeguarded Indeed this indication of gin refers to the preparation method of the gin and not the age P I should like to finish off with a brief comment about vodka Whilst I as a Dutchman am not used to drinking much vodka I do sympathise with my Eastern European colleagues This is why I have decided to back the vodka definition in which only potatoes cereals and sugar beet can be used as raw materials Further to the rapporteurs appeal I will give this matter some more thought on behalf of the ITS Group DE Mr President I welcome the fact that our discussion here and now on labelling designations of origin and the production of spirit drinks is based on a workable compromise that is clearly suitable for preserving tradition and the typical national means of producing spirit drinks across Europe P However I should like to make a few observations on a related problem The age at which people are starting not only to smoke but also to drink alcohol has fallen In the case of the former the EU has already brought itself to undertake common action and also campaigns to strengthen young peoples selfconfidence It is time we did the same in the case of the latter in my opinion What a drink is called is probably of secondary importance as far as young consumers are concerned and will probably not make any difference to the problem For example the introduction of a special tax on alcopops only led people to switch to beer and to winebased premixed drinks which explains why the number of young people drinking themselves into a coma has not gone down P Young people are probably not drinking any more than before the reasons for alcohol consumption have not changed What are significant however are the breakup of social structures such as the traditional family the increasing isolation of young people in front of the television or computer screen and often the lack of alternatives P Highquality production of spirit drinks across Europe is an important matter On the other hand however there is no doubt that the protection of young people from related problems is just as important SK First of all let me express my thanks to the rapporteur Mr Schnellhardt for his work on this topic I would also like to praise the work of several Polish Members in connection with the drafting of amendments aimed at protecting the vodka tradition which has long been a speciality of Eastern European countries These amendments were also aimed at protecting customary timehonoured methods of production which date back to the 15th century and which should be employed in accordance with the traditions of the countries that were the first to produce such beverages P The biggest apple of discord in this report is the definition of vodka namely what ingredients the beverage must contain in order to be designated as vodka Throughout the centuries vodka has been defined in Eastern European countries as a spirit made from grain potatoes or sugarbeet molasses To reiterate the point since vodka is a speciality of the countries of Eastern rather than Western Europe I would ask my colleagues from other countries to respect the definition and not to expand it to include citrusflavoured spirits etc These and different spirits which are the specialities of other countries need another designation primarily to prevent attempts at misleading customers SK Member States rightfully take pride in the fact that longestablished methods of production and processing raw materials are respected recognised and protected when applied to traditional designations such as cognac champagne Scottish whiskey rum port wine etc These are conventional terms and it is natural that manufacturers have clear definitions of the technological processes used in production and similarly of the primary raw materials P It is only natural that manufacturers from traditional countries of origin jealously and carefully guard these definitions For that reason Slovak producers for example had to replace the word rum with a different designation because the Slovak beverage was not made from sugar cane using the original method In other words manufacturers from the new Member States paid their harmonisation dues long ago Now we are facing a situation where it is mostly the EU 15 Member States that must show that they can behave in a fair and proper manner and consistently comply with the same requirements that in the past were imposed on us The matter at hand is vodka as has been discussed here All of a sudden we are witnessing a requirement to designate as vodka second and thirdrate spirits made of bananas and other fruits P Consumers will then be misled into believing that they are drinking vodka and will stop buying the genuine product This will harm the bona fide producers that follow the tradition and make vodka exclusively from the appropriate raw materials Ladies and gentlemen in Finland Poland Slovakia the Czech Republic and all other Scandinavian countries the designation vodka may traditionally be granted only and exclusively to a product made from either grain or potatoes Therefore I ask you to take this into account and to subscribe to these arguments during the vote CS Ladies and gentlemen when we discuss the report on the labelling of alcohol we should take into account not only the technical aspects and the need to ensure the transparency of the European market but also the fact that the production and drinking of alcohol is often linked to local traditions and customs European legislation should therefore not in any way restrict these traditions and customs and certainly not prohibit them P In my country the Czech Republic slivovice is one of the traditional drinks Maintaining traditional methods of producing slivovice is guaranteed under the countrys treaties of accession to the EU and should therefore not be undermined certainly not by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety I should therefore like to call on you ladies and gentlemen to support Amendment 144 tomorrow in the vote and to rectify the mistake that has crept into the report Please lend your support to this tradition which is not just a Czech and Moravian drink but also a wonderful European one SV Mr President ladies and gentlemen there are two reasons why it is important to preserve the traditional definition of vodka the historically significant regional aspect and the consumer aspect P In the Nordic countries and in many of the EUs new Member States we have a long Slavicinspired history and tradition of vodka production in which alcohol is manufactured from potatoes and grain P Champagne and cognac are strictly defined It must be possible for the same rule to apply to vodka the spirit produced from grain or potatoes P If no one knows what vodka is we cannot make informed choices Consumers are entitled to expect vodka to be based on certain ingredients just as we all expect wine to be produced from grapes and gin from juniper berries If we agree that any old alcohol produced from for example bananas or grapes may be called vodka the consumer knows that P The President cut off the speaker PL Mr President today after many months of work and lively debate involving representatives of alcohol and raw ingredients producers as well as distributors and consumers we are discussing Mr Schnellhardts report Unfortunately the solutions put forward in this report have been universally criticised and satisfy no one P Products have been artificially divided into three categories where the vodka category contains no vodkas Instead this group includes brandy whisky rum aquavit and could easily also include our bootleg or moonshine vodka Splitting alcohols up according to specific names gives the impression that we are involved in subliminal advertising rather than trying to find a solution to this problem There is no logic in how this matter is being dealt with As a result and in spite of my sincere wishes and best intentions I have to agree with the dissenting voices in this House and vote against this report Mr President as a Scots MEP I have an obvious interest in any regulation that relates to whisky However we also have other national drinks including a very significant economic interest in vodka and gin distillation and bottling The debates in which I have taken part in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have been interesting at times heated and I have argued strongly for a flexible definition of vodka P Some say that spirits should be treated the same but vodka and whisky are not the same and this proposal simply has to recognise that fact Vodka has traditionally been made from different ingredients in different areas Scotch whisky is a product of centuries of traditional practice by contrast The first reference to Scotch whisky in Scotland was in Exchequer records in 149495 The first taxes were imposed in 1644 P Some spirits have traditionally been rounded off using sugar Scotch whisky has not and this regulation must not allow that to happen Protecting the term Scotch whisky as well as the methods of production under geographic definition is extremely important for Scotland for obvious reasons Some details still have to be underlined in the technical files and I look forward to that P However this firstreading compromise the product of lengthy and very heated exchanges is something that in the spirit of that compromise I am now prepared to accept and I hope that the House will accept it tomorrow SV We are now to adopt a definition of vodka My question is why As a member of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety I wish to devote all my time and energy not to defining varieties of spirit but to working for a better environment and better public health P Public health is genuinely threatened Europe is far and away the continent on which more alcohol is consumed than anywhere else in the world In my own country Sweden consumption has increased by more than 30 since we became Members of the EU P All that a definition sanctioned by the EU will do is paint a picture of vodka as something desirable It is not desirable Vodka is a form of alcohol which is dangerous in unduly high quantities If there is to be a definition of vodka cannot the industry itself come up with it P With all due respect to the rapporteur Mr Schnellhardt the business of coming up with a definition of vodka should be referred back to the place where most of it is produced and where the manufacturers can sit and produce as many definitions as they like We politicians have other things to do Mr President I would like to put aside my prepared text and respond to some of my colleagues who spoke earlier in the debate Mrs McAvan tells us that this measure is designed to protect jobs yet to the extent that it either bans or qualifies the use of the word vodka for existing brands and existing manufacturers it seems likely to have exactly the reverse effect P Mr Maaten asks if we have not been to see a distillery which is a craft industry Well Mr Maaten yes I have I worked in the industry for several years and I can tell you that a malt whisky distillery is indeed a craft industry but a vodka or grain whisky distillery is an industrial process and the process for producing vodka produces pure alcohol whether you make it from sugar or from potatoes or from anything else P All this talk about consumer protection is nonsense The product is identical and the reason we should not compare vodka with whisky or brandy as has been rightly pointed out by my colleague on the other side of the Chamber is because in those products the ingredients significantly affect the flavour Whisky is only whisky if it is made in the proper way but vodka is based on pure alcohol P If I may make a general point we should not be seeking to change the established meanings of words by legislation However in this case the compromise proposed by the rapporteur seems to be the best outcome on offer so I suppose that we must reluctantly support it As happens so often in the European Union we have to make the best of a bad job Mr President as Mr Helmer has pointed out and just to clarify for the House the UK Conservatives are indeed supporting Mr Schnellhardts amendment on vodka The issue which our Scandinavian and Polish colleagues appear to be banking on now is the old equalitywithwhisky argument P I have heard people in the House this evening saying that that we could possibly have a situation where whisky is going to be made out of grapes Well I have to say that these arguments are completely bogus We are trying to define these products for the benefit of consumers to ensure that what is in the bottle conforms to their expectations of what a whisky or a vodka should be As distillers will tell you if you distil at a lower alcoholic strength more taste comes over the still Spirits like whisky are distilled at a low strength and derive their taste from the raw materials Other spirits like vodka are distilled at a high strength and may then even be filtered through charcoal to remove the taste of the raw materials P Our Nordic colleagues and their allies are trying to have it both ways They are asking us to define a product not by reference to its characteristics or by reference to what the consumers expect but by reference to the raw materials that their producers currently use It is interesting that they have not sought to include sulphite waste which was the predominant raw material in Sweden in the 1920s nor apples nor coal and yellow turnips which have all been used in Poland in the past Parliament should not be in the business of defining products so as to exclude producers and distort competition We should be protecting the consumer and it is for that reason that we support the approach being taken by Dr Schnellhardt which avoids artificial restrictions on production while ensuring that consumers are adequately informed PT Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should like to congratulate Mr Schnellhardt on his outstanding report and to commend all those who helped improve on the Commissions proposal to update the law on spirit drinks with a view to making the text clearer simpler and easier to implement for companies and consumers needing more and better information in order to make informed choices P The two regulations currently applicable must be brought under one regulation in order to simplify the law and to adopt a clear policy on spirit drinks Regulations must be adapted to the new WTO requirements and criteria for the recognition of the new geographical indications must be defined P Lastly I should like to say that the new regulation with the contributions from Parliament which I hope will be adopted will help extend international knowledge of drinks that help reinforce the identity of many European regions In particular if I may say so the regulation will enhance the quality and value of European rum from overseas territories and Madeira allowing promoters P The President cut off the speaker PL Mr President would the French agree to Champagne made from plums Would the British be pleased if they were permitted to make apricot gin and peach whisky Of course they would not That would be tantamount to heresy Therefore I am not surprised that the Poles Lithuanians Latvians Estonians Swedes Finns and Danes do not want to recognise as vodka some waste products from the manufacture of wine whisky or gin P Let us call a spade a spade Is the European Parliament to be held hostage by powerful lobby groups representing alcohol manufacturers from southern Europe or the United Kingdom Do we want public opinion in our countries to decide that our Parliament serves as a transmission belt for economic lobby groups from various countries and sectors If we do not want this to happen let us not agree to this ridiculous broad definition of vodka DE Mr President Commissioner I should like to start by thanking Mr Schnellhardt for his excellent work I think he has really produced a workable compromise that we should all support tomorrow P We should bear in mind that this discussion is not about old versus new Member States Nor is it about good versus bad alcohol or about capital versus labour It is about our producing a new version of the Regulation on spirit drinks to adapt it to the current state of affairs This means we want our consumers to be offered good correctly labelled products P If the discussion is now reduced to the vodka issue we must ask ourselves firstly if this is justified and secondly what is behind this P It is very presumptuous however to assert that if alcohol is distilled so much that it loses all taste the starting point of the raw materials is crucial to the products designation Therefore we would do well to simply adapt to the state of affairs prevailing in Europe that vodka is already being produced everywhere even if it may have had its origins in Poland rather than throwing out the baby with the bath water P We should bear in mind that we have achieved a great deal We have improved consumer protection and we have also for example made it possible for traditional products to be labelled more appropriately That is why I am convinced that this is a really good compromise My thanks once more to Mr Schnellhardt We should all support this tomorrow DE Mr President I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur The compromise ensures that spirit drinks will be less synthetic in future which means that we shall see higher quality in the various spirit drinks The compromise also takes account of national interests as an Austrian Jagatee is of course a particular concern of mine P No one in this House can escape the discussion on the definition of vodka I have yet to grasp why many speakers have been acting as though there had been no definition of vodka up to now and the term vodka were now too broad The opposite is the case The European Union does already have a definition of vodka and Parliaments compromise for which the rapporteur is primarily responsible is accommodating towards traditional vodka producers if just a few countries were concerned which as we have heard today is not the case The House should bear that in mind when it comes to tomorrows vote LT Mr President ladies and gentlemen since 1989 when the definition and labelling of alcoholic beverages was introduced there have been many changes Some traditional spiritproducing countries have become members of the European Union First there was Sweden and Finland and now the countries of the secondtothelast round of expansion the Baltic countries and Poland It is from the North that the name vodka derives from and the traditional methods for manufacturing this spirit P Traditionally vodka has always been manufactured from grain In some places it is also made from potatoes and sugar beets Now that traditional vodkaproducing countries have become EU members we would like to see that namely alcoholic spirit beverages made from grain potatoes and sugar beets be called vodka and be labelled as such P A consumer needs to know what whisky is and what it is made from A consumer has the right to buy a product made according to the original and traditional recipes and from traditional ingredients P If this is applicable to whisky then why can it not be applied to vodka I urge my colleagues to vote for a fair compromise vodka only from grain potatoes and sugar beets CS Commissioner ladies and gentlemen as part of the debate on the labelling of alcohol I should like to inform the House of a problem that is overshadowed by the debate over vodka but that has particular significance for the citizens of the Czech Republic in economic political and cultural terms I refer to slivovice a traditional Moravian alcoholic drink made from fruit most commonly from plums This drink came under threat when the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Feed Safety most unfortunately meddled in its definition which is enshrined in the Accession Treaty of the Czech Republic I feel that this was done by mistake rather than deliberately but it is an unfortunate example of politicians meddling P Because mistakes must be rectified I would call on you ladies and gentlemen to support the amendment on slivovice on which I worked with Mr Horst Schnellhardt and which almost all groups have said they will support I should like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for his willingness to reach solutions that would return the definition of slivovice to a model that corresponds to its traditions In the same way that Scandinavians closely follow the development of vodka it is a priority for Czech people that slivovice should continue to take the form of a pure fruit spirit so that the characteristic flavour is not distorted by the addition of various ingredients P Last but not least there is a political dimension to all of this which should not be overlooked and which arises from the fact that the definition of slivovice became part of the accession negotiations and was enshrined in the Accession Treaty The violation of an Accession Treaty would undoubtedly lead to a breakdown of trust between the EU institutions and the Member State concerned not to mention the fact that a dangerous precedent would be set which in some cases might affect other Member States Given that our citizens take a lively interest in the fate of slivovice our lawmakers should show a similar interest Let us therefore take a muchneeded step towards protecting slivovice by adopting the amendment in question PL Mr President although the report on the labelling of spirit drinks deals with over 30 different kinds of beverages I would like to focus on the most controversial issue namely that of the definition of vodka The currently binding definition of vodka was drawn up many years before the main vodka producers joined the European Union Thanks to them the European Union is the third largest vodka producer in the world Parliament should therefore adopt a definition of vodka that would secure the reputation and leading market position of this spirit drink P Maintaining the current definition of vodka and allowing it to be produced from waste material will lower its quality and have a negative impact on its reputation The trade name vodka should be reserved only for vodka that is produced from traditional ingredients namely grain potatoes and beet molasses This was the definition adopted by the European Parliaments Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development Vodka made from ingredients other than the ones traditionally used should be given a specific market name such as nontraditional vodka vodkastyle spirit drink or nonstandard vodka with the name of the raw ingredients used in its production clearly stated on the label If this is not done we will be cheating both ourselves and the consumers P Finally I would like to take this opportunity to invite you all to todays food and wine tasting event to promote Polish organic foods including cold meats juices and vodka made from grain and potatoes FR Mr President since a lot has been said about whisky and vodka I shall say something about rum which is produced in only two places within the European Union those being the French overseas départements and Madeira Since a great deal of it is drunk throughout Europe it is imported from numerous third countries primarily from ACP countries which enjoy special treatment under the 2000 Cotonou Agreement P Rum is one of the overseas départements main export products and the sugar cane rum industry alone accounts for over 40 of the value of exports from Guadeloupe Martinique and Réunion and for 40 000 jobs created there P Where the Communitys definition of rum is concerned then a great deal is at stake rum from the French overseas territories needs to be defined in a way that makes it possible for it to be better distinguished from its thirdcountry competitors specifically by describing it as agricultural rum derived exclusively from sugar cane juice something that consumers recognise as a sign of quality P It is no less important in the eyes of the ACP countries that this definition be consistent with the EUs overall approach to their rum industry if their growth is to be sustained and if the progress made to date by the Caribbean producers is not to be jeopardised It was with this in mind that the professional bodies representing producers in the French overseas départements and in the Caribbean countries agreed in October 2006 at La Barbade on a common position on the Community definition of rum taking as the basis for it a generic definition and going on to draw progressive distinctions between traditional rum agricultural rum and rum refined from sugar P I would like to thank Mr Schnellhardt for taking on board my request for an adequate definition of agricultural rum and for finally deciding to include in his report the definition of it already to be found in the Councils compromise text It has been a considerable amount of work over a long period of time on the part of the whole industry that has made it possible to promote the production of agricultural rum so that the denomination today is one of the principal guarantors of this French overseas products entry onto commercial markets and it is this that makes it possible to hope that the compromise submitted today for this Houses approval will be adopted at first reading SV We Swedish Social Democrats support the compromise on the definition of vodka and for the same reasons that the Swedish centreright government does so in the Council of Ministers We do so because it is the best solution available to Swedish consumers and producers in that it accords an exceptional status to vodka produced in the manner in which we Swedes expect it to be produced namely from potatoes or grain P If the compromise disintegrates there will be no special status accorded to vodka made from potatoes or grain and consumers will still be unclear as to what they are getting when they buy vodka P People may be wondering why the EU has to decide on how vodka should be marketed We do of course have a common internal market in the EU and we therefore also have common rules governing what may be sold in this market and in which ways Democracy should set limits on the market including on the ways in which different products may be marketed P However I deeply regret the fact that not even a majority of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety could support my amendments with regard to putting warning labels on alcohol I intend to return to that issue Mr President I have two points and one surprise P The vodka belt has three arguments The first is culture and tradition we have made vodka out of potatoes and grain for over 500 years P The second is equal treatment when we joined the Union in 1995 we were told that vodka would have a tight definition just like rum whisky or grappa or in line with some of the more traditional geographic definitions for instance of champagne and cognac We therefore want equal treatment for vodka We do not want it to be some kind of alcoholic waste basket P The third is consumption and production we know what we are talking about seven countries produce 70 of the vodka and consume 70 of the vodka P To Mr Stevenson who told me that we are just driving the industry in our own country I would point out that Mr Helmer is defending the same position as the Labour Party so Mr Stevenson do not tell me that you are not driving some kind of grapevodka industry here P Tomorrow as a defender of vodka I will vote for Mr Schnellhardts overall compromise but against his compromise on vodka and for my own amendment on a tighter definition or indeed for the Liberal ones I hope that all traditionalists will do the same P Now we come to my surprise I must admit that I am not a big fan of Polands Kaczyński brothers However they have done a wonderful job in this vodka debate They have defended vodka heroically and I hope that this little token of appreciation I am going to send them a bottle of vodka will make them soften their position on the Constitution Thank you very much You have added another element to this multifaceted at times technical and impassioned debate I do not feel that I am the most appropriate recipient of this gift but I thank you nevertheless HU The production and consumption of alcohol are probably as old as humanity itself Hieroglyphics 45 000 years old in Egypt and clay tablets in Mesopotamia prove how active the ancients were in this area too Following on from the Greek god Dionysus and the Roman god Bacchus the tradition of spirit production was given a new boost during the Middle Ages by Christianity The technologies used have improved while the concepts and labelling have become more precise P In my country Hungary pálinka a 100 fruit brandy was already established as part of our gastronomy at the time of the Renaissance In fact those technologies and products the unchanged combination of which we can still enjoy today were already established across Europe roughly 2300 years ago However over the last 50 years business advertising and later on consumer society itself have completely muddied the clear picture we had up until then The chemical and distilling industries nowadays are continually creating new tastes and aromas offering an amazing selection of drinks At present you can basically make everything from anything This has also been accompanied of course by traditions being watered down There are already fewer and fewer people who know what it is worth drinking why and when P Ladies and gentlemen I am conservative when it comes to my political views and gastronomic habits too I like things to be exactly what they are and not what adverts want you to believe they are This is why I am in favour of a strict definition for every drink including vodka as well Pálinka is made from fruit and vodka from grain potatoes or sugar beet It is all perfectly clear like this P If we blur the defining lines we are not just affecting quality development and our traditions but we are clouding further the already murky picture In that case we can easily take the approach George Orwells hero did in 1984 when he cannot say what he is actually drinking Like everyone else in the book he too calls that horribletasting foulsmelling dishwater gin DE Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the Commission proposal aimed to bring about simplification to combine the two previous regulations into one and it has done so The second aspect adapting the regulations to new technical requirements and to the requirements of the WTO and of TRIPS will also be a success The third objective the continued validity of existing geographical indications which can continue to be supplemented in future by additional designations will also be achieved With some give and take on the part of the individual Member States that too will provide clarity in future P I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr Schnellhardt for the effort he has put into the many difficult negotiations In the dispute over Jägertee or Jagertee Germany has compromised and accepted the term Hüttentee as the German designation All parties must be prepared to take a step closer to one other P A great deal of tradition is involved but mutual tolerance is required By way of explanation the term Champagne refers to the designation of origin that is the regional origin and has less to do with the ingredients In Germany we order a Klarer By this we mean a spirit made from agricultural produce fruit grain or potatoes We have taken steps towards ensuring the clear nature of this product and towards maintaining the economic base of the traditional often small distilleries I believe that this too will succeed P The addition of sweeteners must be regulated and must be clearly visible on the label For centuries our distilleries have been producing topquality spirits without adding flavourings or sugar Labelling constitutes consumer information and ensures a level competitive playing field This also goes for the raw material P We made very heavy weather of the definition of vodka The solution labelling everything that is not produced from potatoes or grain is a workable compromise and provides clear information and I ask you to support this compromise PL Madam President first of all perhaps I can provide you with some information which has not been presented to the House Last week the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats rejected the compromise proposed by the rapporteur Why was the proposal rejected The reason was that the group did not agree by a small majority but a majority nevertheless with the proposed definition of vodka contained in this proposal By the same token there was majority support for acknowledging that vodka is traditionally produced from grain potatoes or beet molasses This was the amendment that I tabled together with my colleague Mr Stubb and I appeal to you to support it P Why this talk of tradition I would like remind you that countries or representatives of countries which have nothing to do with the tradition of vodka production cannot behave like the conquistadors who came to South America and stole Mayan gold This is our tradition the tradition of the vodkaproducing countries and it should be acknowledged in the regulation P We should be aware that the Council has also put unprecedented pressure on the European Parliament A highranking official sent a letter to the representatives of 24 Member States and not only referred to the position of the influential lobby group the European Vodka Alliance but also failed to send this letter to the representatives of two of the countries most involved in this dispute namely Poland and Lithuania The opinions of the European Parliaments Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Economic and Social Committee were not taken into account COPA COGECA the European Union farmers organisations and the European Union farmers themselves all support the traditional definition of vodka Why is this the case The reason is that European potatoes and grain as well as five hundred years of tradition should define the value of this product It should not be changed simply due to pressure from lobby groups P We demand equal treatment Traditionally produced vodka cannot be compared to other similar spirits That would be contrary to the basic operating principles of the European Union Madam President first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report I consider it to be an excellent piece of work This report and this debate have to say the least provoked a considerable disagreement between many Members between groups and within groups I believe that we should support the compromise that has been reached There are other proposals but they cover what one specific viewpoint holds to the detriment of the other P The bottom line should be the quality and the standard of the product Additives are and must be controlled but you cannot ban products that have been used for a long time We have to be aware of the needs of the spirit industry as well as of consumer protection P As some have said this has turned out to be a complex report with some very strong and different points of view but we must have an acceptable agreement Compromise agreements sometimes dilute the original intention of the directive but on this occasion I believe that this is the best we can achieve at the present time This is a very important and serious subject and we must get it right The debate on what vodka is has removed some of the importance of this directive and that is unfortunate but that sometimes occurs in politics P I listened to the different contributions and to my two colleagues from Scotland who protested that they have the longeststanding whisky Where I come from in Northern Ireland we have a little product called Bushmills and we would probably have a good debate as to who actually owned the oldest whiskey on the island of Ireland I shall conclude on that note draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development DA Madam President Commissioner I am draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which has been the advisory committee for this proposal We were almost unanimous in adopting a clear definition to the effect that vodka should be produced from potatoes and grain It was also the intention that there should be extended cooperation on this matter between the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development Unfortunately I have to say that this is not something we have seen much of in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development P Vodka is a quality product with a very long history and this is something we should safeguard We should safeguard vodka production in exactly the same way as we safeguard the production of whisky cognac and all other spirits in Europe What I fail to detect in this Parliament is any respect for those people and countries possessing a culture that includes vodka production It must also be on the basis of shortterm interest that vodka is manufactured as an undefined product and as a dumping ground for surplus ingredients The notion current in recent years that consumers are indifferent to the ingredients from which vodka is produced is misconceived Consumers want information more information and yet more information I should like to close Madam President by thanking once more the rapporteur who has had a difficult job to do but who has managed to put before us a compromise which if I rightly understand all that has been said in the course of this debate is capable of being widely accepted P Let me come back to one of the issues raised although I agree that this has somewhat overshadowed the very important elements in this piece of legislation P As expected the compromise text on vodka was mentioned several times At the beginning I said that the Commission had reservations Those concern the legal basis and not the content of the compromise text From a technical point of view the Commission fully endorses the compromise because in our opinion it strikes the right balance between the traditional vodka producers and those that produce vodka from other raw materials It is a fact that many producers have produced vodka legally for many years from raw materials other than potatoes and cereals and the Commission cannot ignore the legitimate rights and expectations of those producers as you will understand P On the other hand we have also listened carefully to the arguments highlighting tradition and quality The Commission is not deaf to those arguments I think that the compromise found strikes the right balance and apart from some legal aspects therefore has the Commissions full support Having said that the Commission will continue to contribute constructively to the final adoption of this proposal as soon as the underlying conditions are met The debate is closed P The vote will take place on Tuesday 19 June 2007 P Written statement Rule 142 in writing FI The debate on the Regulation on spirits has culminated in an issue which the Commission poohpoohed in its proposal the equal treatment of vodka alongside other strong drinks P It would be more accurate to say however this is about the equal treatment of European cultures Apart from the fact that the debate on now reminds us of the existence of a European multiculture it also at the same time shows that there is still much work to be done in the name of unity which respects differences P The definition of vodka we are wrangling with is in fact a technical amendment to something we already knew about and found to be good for centuries vodka has been manufactured almost entirely from grain and potatoes In the EU 90 of all vodka has also been produced from these raw materials When it comes to defining the ingredients it is therefore not just a question of the interests of manufacturers and artificial market barriers but of tradition The vodkaproducing countries in which 70 of vodka is produced and consumed do actually know what they are talking about P The compromise by the rapporteur Mr Schnellhardt which in practice would permit the manufacture of vodka from any agricultural product as long as there is a small mention of it on the label at the back is inadequate If we have to end up with a compromise it should give greater support to the traditional manufacturing method P The EUs common identity and the legislation that supports that notion must be built on mutual respect where historical facts are recognised Our current legislation on spirits is from a time when the vodkaproducing countries were not members of the EU and so it needs to be updated During the accession negotiations which Finland Sweden and countries which joined the Union later on such as Poland were involved in the definition of vodka was passed over and promises were made to put that right in the near future Now is that time",

    "input": "Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century debate The next item is the report by Jacek Protasiewicz on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century rapporteur PL Madam President Commissioner with this debate we are winding up several months of discussions in the European Parliament on the issue of modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century It has been quite an emotional and sometimes heated debate but this is not really surprising seeing as it is an issue affecting almost every European regardless of their age walk of life or place of living P However intensive discussion has not been confined to this House The publication of the Green Paper has given rise to wide public debate throughout the European Union and has involved numerous trade unions employers organisations local businesses and workers organisations and various nongovernmental initiatives both in the old and in the new Member States P During these months I have gained the impression that the majority of the participants in the debate agree that changes in labour law are necessary because of the challenges brought by this century What challenges were they referring to There were four main challenges Firstly the positive and negative consequences on European economies of advancing globalisation Secondly the rapid development of the service sector which is rapidly giving rise to new jobs both in the new and old Member States although these differ in nature to the jobs once created by industry The third challenge is the sea change in technology and particularly new communications technology which is having a major effect on our present way of working Another great challenge is demographic change which even now has radically changed the situation in the European jobs market and will change it even more radically in the near future P Whilst there has been broad agreement that change is necessary what direction these changes should take is not quite so clearcut Some MEPs have been in favour of greater flexibility in European regulation arguing that this will increase employment and reduce unemployment Others by contrast support a greater protective function for labour law Some MEPs support greater harmonisation of national legal systems saying that this is a requirement of the process of creating a single European market Others steadfastly support the principles of subsidiarity citing differences in the traditions and models prevailing in various Member States and underlining that such diversity is a good thing because it allows best practice to be found through a practical exchange of experience and is preferable to new usually inflexible community regulation P The initial draft of the report that I prepared as a draft position of the European Parliament favoured greater flexibility and opposed harmonisation It also proposed clauses giving a positive assessment of the influence of atypical forms of employment on job creation in the European Union and challenged Member States to apply active employment policy methods and support adaptability designed to protect people rather than specific existing jobs P In the introductory draft report I also pointed out the need to improve EU and national regulations to free businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape I pointed out in addition that excessively restrictive labour law may discourage enterprises from taking on new employees even at times of economic growth Furthermore I drew attention to the key significance of education to improve the chances of workers and the unemployed of finding new jobs In this context I proposed that we appeal to the European Commission Member States and employers to invest in lifelong learning and improve the quality of education for young people in particular as regards the needs of local and regional jobs markets P Finally I drew attention to the great importance of mobility in improving the situation on the European labour market That is why I proposed challenging Member States to remove the barriers imposed on the citizens of other Member States and opening up their domestic labour markets P The first draft of the report provoked a lively reaction from fellow MEPs The heated debate and the 490 amendments proposed to the original text were subjected to further discussion and negotiations with all political groups At this point I would in particular like to thank my colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and in particular Ole Christensen and his advisors for their contribution P The result of the negotiations was put to the vote at an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 18 June in Strasbourg I must admit that the result of the vote was not completely what I myself had wished for I also have the impression that we lost a considerable contribution put forward by myself in the initial draft which in my view was not properly addressed in subsequent debates which was that any reform of the labour market including the reform of labour law should serve to create new jobs in Europe in order to effectively face up to the challenge of the 17 million people who are currently out of work These high unemployment levels are a direct threat to the values on which the European social model is based and we must do everything we can to radically reduce them P There are over 60 amendments to the report in its present form Almost half of them support the approach of creating new jobs I hope that the results of the voting will be satisfactory enough to enable me to recommend that this House adopt this report and that it will be an important vote in the debate which the European Commission started by publishing the Green Paper in November last year Member of the Commission CS Madam President ladies and gentlemen the Green Paper has created a good opportunity for discussion on the need to improve labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century It elicited a huge response from a broad range of interested parties These responses contain useful information on national legal systems and on fresh problems in the European labour market caused by crossborder mobility and the expansion of international trade throughout the EU P The quality of responses to the Green Paper was astonishing and I believe that this is the outcome of consultations and discussions led by the governments and some parliaments of Member States along with the social partners and other interested parties at both EU and national levels Some of the problems that emerged during the course of this public consultation had already been the subject of European Parliament negotiations and resolutions P I should like to congratulate the rapporteur the political groups and the MEPs for their contributions to the wording of this owninitiative report P The report attempts to establish how to make practical use of the debate on the Green Paper in the form of practical measures that would enjoy broad support The Green Paper also fully recognises the Member States competence in labour law and their own labour relations and traditions and progress on collective bargaining The debate has brought to the fore how useful labour law can be in resolving issues relating to cuts to the workforce in a fastchanging world with large mobility of capital and technologies P Labour law and collective bargaining are intrinsically linked Labour law provides a basis on which the social partners at all levels can negotiate compromise agreements on employment relations lifelong learning flexible working time arrangements and the organisation of the labour market which would facilitate movement between jobs and from one type of contract to another It will come as no surprise to anyone that in responses to the Green Paper among social partner organisations there has been a wide variety of opinion on how to move forward Sharp divisions emerged during Parliaments negotiations on this report and in parallel negotiations at EU and national levels in relation to the following points P the status of fulltime standard contracts of indefinite duration in comparison with new flexible forms of work and the emphasis on measures to resolve labour market segmentation P the approach when amending nonstandard contracts some of which lack appropriate guarantees of employment security this mainly involves cases of multilateral employment relations flexibility is often called for without suitable employment protection and without any actual chance of achieving genuine security in the framework of more stable labour relations P the Green Papers emphasis on individual employment relations has raised the issue of whether sufficient attention has been given to the collective dimension of labour law and the benefits of social dialogue P it has been said that the Commission should have restricted this debate to the social partners at EU level and should not have opened up public debate in which EU bodies EU Member State governments and EU and nationallevel social partners were involved P there were also arguments over the contribution the EU could make to supporting labour law reform and to developing minimal social standards applicable to all forms of labour contract P I feel that the report in principle advocates P an examination of flexibility and security as two mutually reinforcing factors contributing to improved productivity and job quality P adopting an approach that when it comes to developing employment security takes account of the life cycle P providing basic protection for all workers regardless of the type of contract that they have signed P help for workers to change jobs quickly and sustainably P ensuring that efforts to modernise labour law are in keeping with the approaches of better lawmaking and of cutting the excessive administrative burden in particular as regards compliance with legal provisions on small businesses P proper implementation of EU legal provisions on work and on improving information for employees and workers concerning the minimum EU provisions in force with particular regard to the fight against illegal work P We believe that the principles of nondiscrimination gender equality flexible working time for the purposes of reconciling work and family life and the opportunities to gain an education and vocational training are the very cornerstones of employment security essential for a smooth transition from one job to another and from one type of employment contract to another P The report acknowledges how complicated it is to distinguish between categories of worker and selfemployed persons There is a prevailing fear that increased crossborder mobility may affect the correct implementation of the Community acquis I welcome Parliaments positive attitude to finding ways of resolving the problem whilst respecting the Member States right to establish whether employment relations are involved in a case P I feel that the report also emphasises the benefits of dialogue between the International Labour Organisation ILO and the EU in this regard We must make the most of the ILOs expertise and experience and use its efforts to establish basic labour standards enabling flexibility and security to coexist P The Commission faces the task of assessing the main themes of this policy and the alternatives to it that have emerged through a number of the answers we have received including those that were recently incorporated into Parliaments owninitiative report P Honourable Members I await with interest the debate on this extremely sensitive and complex issue and expect that it will bring further initiatives and will lead to the successful adoption of the report before us draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs IT Madam President ladies and gentlemen the European Parliament is giving a good account of itself The work carried out so far in committee the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been of a good standard It has escaped the bottleneck of ideological clashes and opposition and has focused attention on the actual subject of the Green Paper on employment policies and on the actual possibility of planning innovation P Globalisation and demographics are only two of the main challenges Sustainable development also requires changes in the way in which work is organised and in the use of time Very careful thought shows that there is no nonworking time but rather time for personal life in addition to family life that we have been wrong to identify the new frontier in social conflict as a conflict between insiders and outsiders that the relationship between flexibility and security is a twoway relationship and includes the needs of employers and the needs of workers that extending rights is an action that must not be so many words on a piece of paper but that requires change and transparency action against undeclared employment a coordination of policies and renewed vigour in harmonisation towards the goal of European employment law draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection NL Mr President I am pleased with this debate but not with the method Commissioner labour law is first and foremost a competence of the Member States and particularly of the social partners It guarantees the right to a decent wage good working conditions and protection in the case of dismissal and makes for a stable social climate which we need for economic growth and productivity In this the normal contract of employment as opposed to assorted precarious statutes is the point of reference P I am therefore pleased that the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs underlines these two crucial elements and that the suggestion from my opinion by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for a European initiative for chain responsibility has been adopted P The discussion on relaxing dismissal conditions is sending the wrong message to European employees In recent weeks I have met with a great deal of indignation in my country about the level of redundancy payments made by Opel Antwerp but I have noticed that there is little indignation among those selfsame people about the immoral restructuring plans which companies are carrying out P Both Parliaments report and the European Trade Union are very critical of the Green Paper and this is why I hope Commissioner that you can address this criticism If one party in social consultation levels criticism of this kind then we owe it to them to give them a decent answer draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Womens Rights and Gender Equality NL Mr Protasiewicz Commission I am not opposed to the reform of labour law if it leads to more certainty for adequate health care unemployment benefits pensions for everyone including those on the lowest incomes P The Commission is turning this argument on its head though Instead of arguing in favour of reinforcing employee rights the Commission intends to turn Europe into a paradise for employers in which the right not to be able to be dismissed without any justification will be consigned to the nostalgic past where you no longer have the right to refuse unpaid overtime and collective labour agreements are deemed oldfashioned P The Commission calls this flexicurity Sounds nice but the translation of what the Commission is hoping to achieve with it is simple More flexibility for the employer and more uncertainty for the employee This will have a particularly disastrous impact on women young people and minorities who already suffer a disadvantage within the labour market and are disproportionately represented in parttime jobs and temporary contracts They will be the first victims if this proposal is adopted intact and the rest will follow on behalf of the PPEDE Group PT Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I should like first of all to commend rapporteur Protasiewicz for his efforts However I must say that the report such as it has been presented to us is unbalanced It is unbalanced because it covers above all aspects relating to social protection which are undoubtedly important but ignores the other fundamental perspective for a reform of the labour laws for the twentyfirst century which must take into consideration greater flexibility in the functioning of the labour markets In addition the text rests on a very conservative view further fuelled by a culture based on suspicion and conflict Well what we need today is the opposite a culture based on trust and cooperation between the sides P This paradigmatic amendment which is absolutely essential if the values of social justice and human dignity are to be reconciled with increased competitiveness does not appear to have been assumed in this report A clear expression of the balance to which I refer and which is absent from the text of the report would be fundamental in encouraging a change in behaviour and attitudes on the part of firms and workers with a view to encouraging confidence levels P In short the text of this report is in some way a disappointment because it gives no indication that modernday Europe has the spirit talent and capability to become more competitive whilst simultaneously demonstrating the capacity to preserve the values that are representative of its social model The truth is that the text under discussion shows no signs of spirit and no evidence of either talent or reform capability For this reason the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats has put forward a series of amendments which will if approved ensure that this report does not become a lost opportunity on behalf of the PSE Group DA Madam President I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr Protasiewicz for his constructive cooperation in preparing the report If the EU is to tackle the challenges of the 21st century and create sustainable growth with more and better jobs we shall have improved the quality both of jobs and of work per se Labour law has a crucial role to play in this area If we compete on the basis of poor working conditions and low wages we shall lose out against a background of increased globalisation and competition Security of employment is a factor in production A high degree of security promotes flexibility employment and competitiveness This is a consideration that should be reflected in future labour law and I reject any attempt to undermine the social and economic security for which employees have had to fight hard over a great many years P In recent years we have witnessed a clear increase in the use of atypical employment contracts but this is unfortunately also a sign of companies wanting to circumvent labour law and their social obligations There are unfortunately still too many employees who have no choice in being offered such contracts and who do not enjoy protection and security They are often forced into jobs without pensions and without sick pay or maternity leave There are also still many employees working without basic social rights The International Labour Organisation has on quite a number of occasions pointed out the connection between on the one hand reduced security and poorer health in the workplace and on the other hand shortterm contracts That being said however we also think that standard fulltime contracts should be the norm Contracts of indeterminate length are good for both employees and companies They provide security predictability and increased opportunities for development P Flexibility and security of employment are not opposites but instead preconditions of each other This is something that needs to be reflected in future labour law Flexibility is basically about developing constructive cooperation and about mutual trust within companies It means that the collective bargaining system and the social dialogue have a major role to play in developing flexicurity The Socialist Group in the European Parliament rejects the Commissions narrow focus on individual labour law The best balance between flexibility and security is achieved in many countries through the signing of collective agreements that are constantly adapted to developments in terms of both employees and companies needs The Commission must therefore promote the social dialogue both at national and European levels on behalf of the ALDE Group IT Madam President ladies and gentlemen I would also like to welcome the work that has been done not only by the rapporteur but I believe by all the groups as a whole This has produced the text we are considering which was adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but I would like to try to clarify one point I do not think that conservative and disappointing ideas prevail in the text adopted P I believe that this text is a contribution to overcoming every resistance and ideological barrier to forms of flexibility in the employment relationship that today often not only exist but constitute a need to allow the system of companies at European level to respond to the competitive challenges posed to them on a worldwide scale P In order to protect these needs however it is necessary for these forms of contract to be genuinely finalised A more flexible contract whether it be parttime fixedterm or with temporary employment agencies responds to a need for flexibility in the just in time response to peaks in demand and to production supply needs which exist in the competition on the employment market It must not be on the other hand an inappropriate instrument for introducing forms of discrimination on costs and safeguards which would transform the flexible contract into a kind of basis or short cut for social dumping that has nothing to do with the requirements of competitiveness and that transforms the challenge of competition into a challenge of mere competition on costs This is why I believe that while we are affirming the need to accept the existence of these contractual forms and not to oppose them on ideological grounds we also need to raise the level of specific protection and guarantees linked to these forms of flexible working P The rest follows the primacy of collective regulation over individual exceptions the fact that there are European areas of responsibility that respect national prerogatives in the social field and that there is a Community dimension governed by subsidiarity of specific regulatory competence to guarantee minimum standards which give a meaning to the European dimension not reducing it to mere squeezing onto the market the fight against the underground labour market and finally the rejection of the logic of trade P The problem is to achieve these objectives in a balanced way and certainly to avoid trading safeguards such as safeguards in companies for the safeguards of the employment market We need to push everything that promotes highquality forms of mobility and transition and once again forms that are not linked to contradictions regarding social safeguards on behalf of the UEN Group PL Madam President the Green Paper proposed by the Commission and the report we have discussed is in my opinion a valuable introduction to a longer debate on the adaptation of labour law to the changing realities both in Europe and in the world P This is only the beginning and we are facing an extremely complicated task We need to achieve results which are hard to reconcile such as increasing the number of jobs while preserving their quality guaranteeing social security for workers and keeping as many standard contracts of employment as possible while at the same time looking after employers interests and dealing with competition in the global market P One issue is paramount regardless of whether a contract of employment is fulltime or not or whether there are more atypical forms of employment or conventional contracts of employment every EU citizen must have the right to work or to provide alternative services and definitely the right to guaranteed health services P My political group will gladly vote in favour of this report in tomorrows voting on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen The debate on liberalising the postal services has taken up a lot of our time today It also shows that it is typically in the field of services that liberalisation is attended by an increase in precarious labour relations P In the face of such developments everybody expects the Commission to support workers rights in a Green Paper on workers rights to set minimum standards at European level to prevent workers rights from going into freefall and to strengthen trade union representation and social dialogue Instead the Commissions Green Paper starts talking about ideas of Flexicurity which opens the floodgates to social dumping which has caused bitter disappointment and will lead to a rise in Euroscepticism P This House has made a clear amendment here workers rights are not exclusive but apply to all employees regardless of what their collective bargaining situation is It is the situation on the ground that is decisive More flexibility is only possible if there is greater security This is the only way in which the report can be further developed on behalf of the GUENGL Group IT Madam President ladies and gentlemen Europe concerns itself too little with employment problems and when it does concern itself with them it does so totally inadequately as if employment were not at the heart of building democracy and of the European social model Certainly many of the reasons for the problems of Europe lie in this culpable and deliberate undervaluation Within Europe job insecurity is very widespread and is hindering social cohesion constituting a real tragedy in fact the major social tragedy being experienced by whole generations of young people as well as older workers who have been prematurely ejected from the labour market All this has an effect on our cities our families and on all of us P Combating job insecurity is vital when it comes to building a future and to providing certainty and hope This is our main task The Commission instead of combating job insecurity seems to be adopting it and almost using it to reduce individual and collective rights to further reduce the role of the trade unions and to set against each other those who have rights who are in fact becoming increasingly few and those who do not in the name of a socalled employment policy P This is unacceptable What needs to be said is that Europe considers employment to be the basis of true democracy and social cohesion and that Europe has its own concept of what constitutes normal work stable employment for an unlimited period protected by contracts and by the role of the trade unions and with a requirement for equal conditions for standard and nonstandard jobs as part of employment equality This idea of employment is a healthy idea which benefits production as well because it says that competition is not based on exploitation but on quality and innovation Saving on employment costs and making workers compete against each other garners easy profits in the short term but does nothing to make the economy or society grow P This is the social model that Europe should present to the world and it should put itself forward as an example The right to work is a fundamental element of democracy because it demonstrates the rules for activity upon which society rests Within these rights we should build a social unit of young and old instead of placing them in a ridiculous opposition The employment contract should contain these rules and rights which cannot be delegated to others or replaced by external action which would leave the employment contract at the mercy of the law of the jungle This is why we are not convinced by the concept of flexicurity of weak contracts replaced by welfare benefits no the benefits must be in the contract and they must act as safeguards for the worker as a European citizen P The text that has been submitted to Parliament is a compromise it has ambiguous points but important elements too Attacks on this employment such as those contained in some of the amendments would be negative and would lead us in a backwards direction I say this in particular to my socialist comrades especially with regard to those amendments that distort the nature of normal employment We would consider the approval of these amendments to be a breach of the compromise agreed on in committee on behalf of the INDDEM Group Madam President the rapporteurs first draft was not well received in committee because he was trying to cut back on red tape and to reduce the regulations meant to protect workers but which in fact cause unemployment P We are debating the second draft which was more acceptable he had toned it down A pity because it means we are to continue with many of the restrictive practices in the name of harmonisation while all the time that which you fear globalisation is stealing up on you For that the EU will have to cope with competition on the free world markets but you are not prepared for that P Unless you learn to compete in Europe you will not be able to compete globally Footballers continually practise ball skills and teamwork they do not prepare for a match by playing cards in a backstreet bar Likewise continued practice in Europes protectionist systems will mean defeat in the most competitive matches played away on hostile global playing fields Madam President it is the policy of my party the British Conservative Party to reinstate the optout which was agreed at Maastricht and to withdraw the United Kingdom from EU employment and social legislation I trust that my Conservative colleagues in this House will have the full support of their political group the PPEDE in implementing this policy P Turning to the report I was astonished to read in recital C that the EU is not only a free trade area Anyone who knows the first thing about international trade will know that the EU is not a free trade area at all it is a customs union They will also know that the customs union or Zollverein is a 19th century Bismarckian concept which should have no place in the 21st century All the evidence from around the world shows that free trade areas work while customs unions work far less well Indeed the EU is the only group of developed countries still operating in this outdated mode If this House wishes to convert the EU from a customs union with political pretensions into a modern effective free trade area it will have my full support P The Commissions proposals on modernising labour law and our first draft report show a belated recognition of the huge damage that intrusive and inflexible labour market rules have done to European economies They made the first tentative steps towards liberalisation However amendments passed in the Unemployment Committee reverse the direction and turn the report into a regressive socialist wishlist of deeply harmful proposals P Todays amendments restore the balance and so long as they are maintained the reports timid measures are better than nothing and deserve our support Paragraph 2 quotes the Charter of Fundamental Rights That Charter was signed off twice by Tony Blair yet after the Brussels summit of 22 June he came back like Chamberlain from Munich declaring he had protected his red line and that the charter would not affect UK labour law Could the Commission please give me a clear yes or no answer Is Blairs optout legally defensible I look forward to the Commissions reply As we have reached voting time the debate is now suspended It will be resumed at 3 pm",

Eurozone annual report 2007 20072143INI and P the report by Gay Mitchell on behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs on the European Central Banks annual report for 2006 P I am very pleased to welcome the President of the Euro Group the Luxembourg Prime Minister and Finance Minister JeanClaude Juncker I am also delighted to welcome the President of the European Central Bank JeanClaude Trichet to the European Parliament Let me also extend a warm welcome to Commissioner Joaquín Almunia rapporteur Mr President I am pleased to present the second ever report of the European Parliament in response to the Annual Report of the European Commission on the Eurozone The Commissions report presents the economic situation in the Eurozone in 2007 P The results of the report are cause for satisfaction The economic growth rate in the Eurozone rose to 27 which is the best result since 2000 whilst unemployment fell to 76 the lowest in 15 years At the same time the Eurozone has become an increasing factor in stabilising the world economy P This generally optimistic picture however should not conceal some negatives and these are what we focus on in our report Firstly the rate of fiscal adaptation particularly in countries with large budget deficits is too slow bearing in mind that the stability and growth pact obliges Member States to maintain as balanced a budget as possible in the medium term That involves building up a budget surplus in good times to have a financial reserve for times of recession In this context we are critical of the behaviour of some Member States who are not making use of the current period of growth to implement the necessary cuts in public spending P Secondly Parliament points out that the good average results for the whole of the Eurozone cover up substantial differences in the economic situation from one Member State to another Of particular concern is the declining international competitiveness of some countries economies most frequently due to wage rises in excess of the increase in productivity P Thirdly we call for a continuation of the structural reforms required by the guidelines of the new Lisbon Strategy We have to increase the speed at which the remaining barriers in the markets for goods and services are removed and help further integration of the labour and financial markets which will become an important element in the proper functioning of the Eurozone We would like in particular to draw attention to the speedy implementation of the services directive which has brought accelerated growth in labour productivity and cut inflation in the services sector This is particularly important as services make up 70 of the GDP in the Eurozone P Fourthly Parliament stresses the importance of further extending the Eurozone to strengthen economic and monetary union and the common currency We are pleased at the decision to accept Cyprus and Malta into the Eurozone and look forward to other states joining it in the not too distant future We would like to point out that the process for ascertaining the readiness of countries applying for the Eurozone should be transparent and based on uniform criteria whose economic rationale and political importance should be in no doubt P In this regard we call upon the Commission and the Council to start a serious debate on the nominal convergence criteria P Finally I would like to emphasise the importance of good governance and intensified policy coordination in the Eurozone We need this if we are to make full use of the opportunities provided by the common currency I am pleased at the decision taken by the Euro group in April this year to adopt benchmarks for the fiscal policies of Member States We expect the implementation of these decisions to be closely monitored I would like to take this opportunity to assure Mr Juncker that in this matter he has the full support of Parliament P I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Almunia on preparing the Commissions second report on the economic situation in the Eurozone and express the wish that the reports prepared in coming years bring just as good news as this one rapporteur Mr President I am happy for this report to be debated jointly with the report on the eurozone I would add that the report I am presenting was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs P Starting with the economic situation in 2006 the economic recovery in the eurozone became a selfsustaining process with domestic demand acting as the main driver Two million jobs were created in 2006 and unemployment fell from 84 to 76 In the context of this recovery I would like to stress the main points of the report Against the background of the recent recovery any further raising of interest rates should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth It is crucial that wages increase in line with productivity in order to preserve competitiveness in Member States and to allow for job creation in a noninflationary environment Fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve longterm growth P The report observes that small economies have performed better than large economies since the creation of the eurozone in terms of growth with notably Ireland Finland Greece Luxembourg and Spain achieving a higher average growth rate than the eurozone average and we say that lessons might be drawn from such developments The report expresses concern about the ongoing appreciation of the euro against most major European currencies Article 111 of the Treaty assigns responsibility for exchange rate policy to the Council but without specifying how this responsibility should be exercised P The report calls on the Eurogroup the Council and the ECB to exercise their respective powers and responsibilities in full coordination The report also calls on the ECB to monitor closely developments in the use of the euro as a reserve currency for central banks and in the context of its annual report on the international role of the euro to quantify and analyse the effects of this particularly as regards exchange rates Mr Trichet will be aware that every time he has appeared at Parliaments Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee during the last two years I have raised with him the issue of house prices This remains a concern of mine Therefore the report calls for the ECB to monitor closely these developments which have the potential to have consequences for the real economy The report contains a request that the ECB present ways forward with their respective advantages such as including real estate in the harmonised index of consumer prices or devising a specific type of indicator or suggesting specific measures to be taken at national level due to heterogeneities among the national markets P I refer later on to the Fed formula Perhaps it is time to develop an ECB formula to help forecast the likely effect of interest rate increases on house prices My report also raises the issue of subprime lending and suggests that lessons can be learned in the EU from the potential difficulties for the US economy of subprime lending P I would like to take a moment to address an issue of particular concern to Ireland but which has potential interest for other eurozone members Last year in Ireland house prices were forecast to increase by 9 by estate agents Hook and McDonald by between 8 and 10 by Sherry Fitzgerald and by 7 by Friends First and IIB while Allied Irish Banks forecast an increase of between 3 and 6 The recent Irish Permanent tsbESRI index shows in fact that house prices fell by 21 between January and May 2007 and a further decline in Ireland is expected Subprime lending that is lending to poorer people those with an irregular income stream or difficult history of meeting loans is projected to grow to EUR 4 billion in Ireland this year If the average loan was between EUR 200 000 and EUR 400 000 then between 10 000 and 20 000 such loans exist in Ireland alone Subprime lenders are relatively new to the Irish market and generally charge about twice the going mortgage rate to compensate as they put it lenders for higher risk In one case a mortgage company operating in Ireland since 2005 has already repossessed 30 homes P There are also signs of concern in Britain about subprime lending It has been known for some time that there is a Fed formula in the United States The Fed formula devised by the US Federal Reserve according to one of its former economists shows that typically when house prices have been driven up for several years by low interest rates when interest rates increase prices begin to decline roughly 18 months to 2 years later I believe that the ECB should follow this formula and develop an ECB formula because at present we are leaving it to people who are involved in the industry to make the forecasts and they are the people the financial institutions and others who have most to gain P The report urges the Commission to assess the quality of supervision and offshore location of hedge funds It reiterates points made in the past about democratic scrutiny and the need to publish summary minutes It draws attention to the fact that overdraft rates in the euro area vary from 7 to 135 and asks that the ECB evaluate this P It ends by saying that the number of banknotes in circulation stood at 113 billion with a value of EUR 6282 billion last year but that it is concerned about the growth in the number of 50 euro 100 euro and 500 euro banknotes 500 euro banknotes alone have increased by 132 My report with the support of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee raises the possibility of criminal activities in the use of these large banknotes and says that it requires further examination by the ECB I hope Mr Trichet will be in a position to respond to this report and in particular not today but perhaps over a certain period to consider my suggestion about an ECB formula to equate with the Fed formula so that there can be a true and accurate measure of the likely knockon effect of interest rate increases on house prices in the Member States of the eurozone President of Eurogroup FR Mr President Commissioner Mr President of the European Central Bank Madam President of the committee rapporteurs ladies and gentlemen P We in Europe have replaced the fundamental debate with simple words We are invited to Parliament I hardly ever see it to the plenary as it is called and we talk I note of the everyday living conditions of Europeans something that undoubtedly enhances the credibility of our institutions P European newspapers especially this weeks report the words that were supposedly exchanged during a recent Eurogroup with an evening visitor whom we had the pleasure of hosting I have read a summary of these long debates in editorials that take up scarcely 25 lines and we complain that Europeans are poorly informed of what is really going on in Europe So be it P On the other hand I am pleased to note that one or two nuances aside there is very little difference between the substance of the report by our friend Mr Rosati and our the Eurogroups joint consideration since our joint finding is that growth in Europe is on the up again is expanding is continuing and everything rests on our knowing whether in a few months time we will be able to see whether or not this prolonged recovery this renewed growth in Europe will enable us to say that the growth potential of the European Union and of the eurozone in particular has substantially increased We are agreed in our finding that the levels of underemployment of unemployment are going down We have had the lowest unemployment level for a very long time now There is no doubt about that The fact remains however that it must be stressed that the European Union which is meant to be a model for the world but which still has an employment rate that is structurally higher than 7 has no reason to seek plaudits from others or to proclaim itself victorious over the phenomenon of unemployment on our continent P The deficits are decreasing We saw a distinct upturn in the situation of Europes public finances during the period 20052006 That is true above all where the deficit is concerned Its level of 25 in 2005 decreased to 16 in 2006 which clearly proves that the corrective arm of the reformed Stability and Growth Pact has proven itself and this despite all the generally poor warnings that were given to us when we amended the Pact P It is true that where the preventive arm of the Pact is concerned we struggle to produce the same successes that we have been able to produce with the recovery of public finances in its corrective part We the members of the Eurogroup there are 13 of us now and there will be 15 of us as from 1 January remain committed to the effectiveness of the policies that must be implemented in order to make the preventive arm of the Pact really develop really take off P When the economy is going well when growth rates provide so many grounds for satisfaction when economic growth gets back on track it is clear that those times which in Franglais we call good times must be turned to good account so that the structural deficits in our public finances can be brought down Hence the huge importance that we accord to achieving the mediumterm objective quickly something that requires Member States of the eurozone to redouble their efforts in order to achieve their mediumterm objective in time P It will not have escaped you that on this point the informal Eurogroup that was held in Berlin on 20 April took a decision that involves a commitment being made since we said that all the Member States should meet the mediumterm objective in 2008 and 2009 Some of them managed to delay this until 2010 without having their cases clarified There was never a question of not meeting the objective until 2012 This was of course the main topic of discussion when recently at the start of the week we met the French President who came and we ought to welcome this to explain to us at Eurogroup the new headings and the new aims of Frances economic and budgetary policy We approve heartily of the set of reforms under way because they are structural reforms sought by the French Government and by the French President but we would emphasise that which we expect and demand from France like the other Member States of the eurozone it must meet the mediumterm objective that we have set ourselves on 1 January 2010 This is a remark that applies to France it may easily apply to countries farther south and in an ecumenical way to all the Member States of the eurozone However we have been given reassurances regarding a reduction in the deficit in 2008 as compared with 2007 regarding the principle which has been accepted by the French authorities of allocating all the profits from revenue made in relation to budget estimates in so far as the revenue is shortterm revenue and regarding the reduction in the deficit and the debt P We all believe since this is a subject that is brought up by the press both in France and across the border into Germany we are after all in Strasbourg that no countries tried in any working language of the European Union last Monday in the setting of Eurogroup to call into question the independence of the European Central Bank Moreover if someone were to take the liberty of doing so it would not be enough for them to be expressive in voicing a misguided thought for respect must still be shown for the Treaties We wanted an independent Central Bank we have an independent Central Bank It will of course remain an independent central monetary authority P Applause P The strength of the euro is another subject that gives rise to debate However we do not see the ministers of Eurogroup under the present circumstances today even claim that a strong euro is liable to jeopardise economic growth in the eurozone Rather we believe that the Member States that are uneasy about this strength of the European currency in relation to the outside strength that reflects the robustness of Europes economic recovery should ensure within their countries by introducing the necessary structural reforms that their national economic systems that is to say their systems under the eurozone become more competitive P I was sensitive to the remarks made by your rapporteur in his report on the derailing of certain elements of wage policy A large number of company managers are being granted allowances that in no way correspond to the appeals made again and again both by the Bank and by Eurogroup for a wage moderation policy that is understood properly that is for wage moderation that keeps up with the pace of the increase in productivity We ought not to be surprised that European workers can no longer get to grips with a Europe in which some people earn a fortune without working when one sees the volume of work that that requires and the others have to resign themselves to accepting this to being subjected to the appeals that we launch to them to encourage them to support wage moderation Applause It is economic and social injustice that is now taking hold We must react to it P I agree with your rapporteur that when viewed from the outside the economic zone must be represented as being more solid more of a single entity but I cannot say that I understood the full scope of his ambition when he advocates a single representation of the eurozone internationally P In spite of his qualities Mr Trichet will not succeed in making me withdraw from the European scene I am here and here to stay And as far as I am concerned I have no ambition no vague desire that is driving me to force the other JeanClaude to step down Which one of us moreover could have the idea of eliminating the Commission from the external representation of the eurozone The eurozone may be represented externally by one party even if there are three of us provided that there is an agreement among the three partners representing the eurozone externally That agreement exists It will have escaped no one that on the key points of monetary policy be it internal or external policy we share exactly the same ideas and convictions P I have restricted my remarks to the key points Mr President because that is what is asked of us by your Rules of Procedure which I find particularly strict when the aim is to talk more vividly about the crucial and as Parliament often says everyday problems of Europeans Mr President ladies and gentlemen I have the honour of presenting to you today the annual report of the European Central Bank for 2006 This is an important tool for giving an account to the people of Europe to their elected representatives to Parliament of monetary policy and of our activities in our areas of responsibility P ECB DE I would like to start by giving a short review of economic and monetary developments in 2006 and explaining the monetary policy decisions taken by the ECB I would then like to say a few words on financial stability and on the issue of payment systems P I will start with the economic and monetary issues In 2006 the ECBs monetary policy continued to anchor medium and longterm inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability reflecting the credibility of the ECB in conducting its monetary policy As has been said by the rapporteur very eloquently in 2006 the euro area economy expanded at the highest growth rate since 2000 Notwithstanding the impact of high and volatile oil prices real GDP rose by 29 compared with 15 in 2005 The economic recovery gradually broadened in the course of 2006 and the nature of economic expansion became increasingly selfsustaining with domestic demand acting as the main driver The latest data and survey releases have remained broadly positive supporting the view that economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of 2007 continued to expand at solid rates Looking ahead the mediumterm outlook for economic activity remains favourable and the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate P Regarding price developments average annual HICP inflation in 2006 was 22 unchanged compared with the previous year This was above the ECBs aim to keep inflation over the medium term below but close to 2 Although this outcome mainly reflects the increases in oil and commodity prices and although inflation has been slightly below 2 in the first half of 2007 there is no room for complacency P The outlook for price stability over the medium term remains subject to upside risks As capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is high and labour markets are gradually improving constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments In addition pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment Our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevailed has been confirmed throughout the period from the start of 2006 to mid2007 by crosschecking with the monetary analysis The marked dynamism of monetary and credit growth in 2006 and 2007 reflected a continued persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion adding further to liquidity accumulation P To address the upside risks to price stability identified by the ECBs economic and monetary analyses the Governing Council has as you know adjusted the monetary policy stance gradually in eight steps since the end of 2005 As I said last Thursday in explaining the assessment of the Governing Council after the adjustments in the key interest rates the ECBs monetary policy remains still on the accommodative side with overall financing conditions favourable money and credit growth vigorous and liquidity in the euro area ample Firm and timely action continues to be warranted to ensure price stability over the medium term The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks over the medium term do not materialise P As regards fiscal policies the ECB shares the view expressed in the draft resolution that fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve longterm growth For the Governing Council as was very eloquently said I have to say by both the rapporteur and by the President of the Eurogroup it is important that all governments comply with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal consolidation and that all the countries concerned honour the commitments made at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April 2007 As agreed in Berlin taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area countries to achieve their mediumterm objectives in 2008 or 2009 and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest P I have to say that we also very much welcome the emphasis which has been placed by the ECOFIN Council on measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances P Turning to structural policies the motion for a resolution adopted by the ECON Committee refers several times to economic divergences in the euro area Let me stress first that overall inflation differences among euro area countries have fallen and are currently relatively limited by historical standards The magnitude of current inflation and output differentials at the moment I am speaking is similar to those that are observed across regions or states within the United States of America a vast continental economy which has an order of magnitude a dimension which is of the order of magnitude of ours That being said a single currency means a single monetary policy and a single exchange rate visàvis other currencies It is therefore all the more important to ensure that all the national shock adjustment mechanisms function perfectly The efficient and smooth functioning of economic adjustments within the euro area requires the removal of institutional barriers to flexible wage and pricesetting mechanisms as well as the completion of the Single Market and thus greater crossborder competition Indeed welldesigned structural reforms implemented by national governments are crucial to improve the functioning of product labour and financial markets and to reinforce competitiveness P We also consider that free and undistorted competition fosters longterm economic growth and job creation and facilitates the maintenance of price stability in the euro area P Let me say a word now on financial stability which I know is a very important issue for Parliament We would acknowledge the positive role that hedge funds play by contributing to enhancing the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets We should also be aware however that hedge funds can represent also a source of risk to the stability of the financial system Against this background the report which was issued in May 2007 by the Financial Stability Forum at the request of the G8 on highlyleveraged institutions is welcome The report contains a number of recommendations addressed to supervisors hedgefund counterparties and investors and the hedgefund industry itself which I fully share As for the role to be played by the industry more than ever we will support the proposal that the hedgefund sector would strive for best practices and that industryled benchmarks would be a suitable tool to pursue this objective In this vein the recent initiative that has been undertaken by the industry to set up a working group to review best practices is a very welcome development and I look forward to the result of such work P My final remarks perhaps concern the integration of payment systems in Europe I have noted with satisfaction that the approach of the Single Euro Payments Area and the Target 2 project is very positive and we will continue in the Eurosystem to play our role in this regard P As far as T2S is concerned we have put into place a governance model for the development phase which seeks to involve all stakeholders through the creation of an Advisory Group on T2S where market players are well represented In April 2007 we launched an official public consultation on the principles and proposals underlying the T2S Project The first preliminary assessment of these comments shows that their feedback is generally positive Out of 67 proposals we have obtained a total of 3200 remarks from 56 institutions and we have noted that 60 of these 3200 remarks indicated full agreement to the proposals while only 6 indicated full disagreement All the feedback received has been published and is being very carefully considered P Thank you very much for your attention Member of the Commission ES Mr President Mr PresidentinOffice of the Council Mr President of the European Central Bank ladies and gentlemen I believe that it is very positive that for the first time we are holding this debate on the situation of the eurozone which is the second we have held following the first resulting from the first Commission report on the eurozone and the report on the European Central Bank simultaneously leading to an overall reflection on the situation of the eurozone on the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union and on the prospects for the future P I must thank both Mr Rosati and Mr Mitchell for the wonderful reports they have presented to us and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the work it has done in the debate on the proposals that we are currently discussing P The proper functioning of the eurozone is a matter of crucial importance to our citizens I must tell you from the outset however that I am worried that many European citizens who carry and pay in euros every day are not showing any great satisfaction with the single currency at a time when the eurozones economy is clearly recovering when economic growth is above our potential and above that of the United States when the eurozone is enjoying a recovery as Mr Trichet has said based on internal demand which was not the case a few years ago P It is a recovery with investment that is growing in a very satisfactory manner and which heralds future improvements in our economy and with an economy that is helping to generate in the case of last year two million jobs in the countries of the eurozone And all of this with a practically even trade balance with an inflation rate currently below 2 and a stability that any of the worlds economic areas would want P I believe that everybody the Commission of course but also the Council and in particular the Eurogroup the European Central Bank and the European Parliament have the responsibility to explain to our citizens that this European project eight years after its creation is currently yielding very good results I believe that this debate must serve to do that P But it must also help us to learn from experience to establish which elements of the Economic and Monetary Union are not functioning as we had imagined eight years ago and to implement the adaptations and political decisions required in order to make the future better than the present however positive the present may be Following the Ecofin meeting yesterday more Europeans are going to share in this positive present Yesterday Ecofin formally adopted the latest decisions required in order to confirm that the eurozone would be enlarged to include Malta and Cyprus on January 2008 On 1 January of this year it was enlarged to include Slovenia Next year three new Member States will also have joined the Economic and Monetary Union sharing the single currency with 318 million other Europeans P I believe that that is a very positive element which was debated yesterday and agreed to everybodys satisfaction not just by the 15 members of the eurozone but also by the other 12 States that do not yet share the single currency and I believe that that is worth stressing at this point P With regard to the economic situation I am not going to refer to it in detail since both Mr Juncker and Mr Trichet have already done that P With regard to the application of the Stability and Growth Pact which I believe relates to this improvement in the economic situation and this economic stability that we are enjoying in the eurozone I must say as Mr Juncker has already said that the application of the corrective part of the revised Stability Pact the application of the excessive deficit procedures is having a very positive effect This year we have abrogated three excessive deficit procedures relating to three members of the eurozone including the zones two leading economies France and Germany which are no longer in a situation of excessive deficit P We have also abrogated the excessive deficit procedure relating to Greece Excessive deficit procedures are currently still in place for two countries of the zone Italy and Portugal If things carry on as they are by the end of the year Italy will have corrected its excessive deficit and it will be well below 3 and if things carry on as they are then Portugal if not this year then next year will have corrected its excessive deficit by the end of 2008 as requested by the Council P With regard to the eurozone therefore the application of that element of the Pact which is the bestknown element and most striking element and the element with the strongest and most powerful instruments in the hands of the Commission and the Council is being carried out satisfactorily P It is the preventive part that we are concerned with now The Eurogroup debated it on Monday and Ecofin debated it yesterday This is the most topical and most difficult debate during economic good times because during economic good times it is more difficult not in economic terms but in political terms to carry on consolidating public finances and the instruments in the hands of the Commission and the Council to assist in that correction of public finances beyond the 3 limits and towards the midterm objective of balance in structural terms They are weaker instruments from a legal point of view and they must be based on political consensus on peer pressure and on the conviction that that is a necessary condition for sustained growth P We have recently debated once again this very week the situation in Italy which is one of excessive deficit but we should now be considering how to move its consolidation process forward and it is being considered with great difficulty We are lucky enough not to have to debate the situation in Germany so much because a lot of progress has been made on fiscal consolidation in Germany And we have begun to debate the situation in France P I am going to tell you my opinion on Mondays debate in the Eurogroup expanding on what Mr Juncker has said There is one very positive fact The French President has promised the Finance Ministers of the eurozone and the President of the European Central Bank and of the Commission that he is going to promote a very serious programme of reforms which he will set out in detail between now and September P There is also a second very positive fact He has promised to allocate all of the budget surplus to fiscal consolidation and debt reduction And something new at the meeting of the Eurogroup he said if I can adjust the deficit in 2010 I want to adjust the deficit in 2010 something that was not clear before the meeting of the Eurogroup Though it is also true that he added if I cannot do so I shall have to do so in 2012 P That explanation however did not end on Monday because another element of that meeting that I believe to be very important is that the debate on the French budgetary strategy and the debate on the budgetary strategy of any other country will take place just has it has been until now within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact with France presenting a revised stability programme which will be analysed by the Commission and by the Council and it will be the ministers meeting within the Council in the Eurogroup and also within Ecofin who will give their opinion on the programme of fiscal consolidation and adjustment presented by France P I believe that this should be stressed because some people have interpreted what has happened over recent days as the second death of the Pact which some people had claimed was dead in 2003 I believe that it is alive and kicking The problem is that it is difficult to apply it during good times in the cycle in certain countries in particular That is what the pacts instruments are for however to help overcome those difficulties P I would like to make a final brief comment Mr President relating to the importance that the new Treaty will have when it enters into force in terms of giving the Eurogroup more institutional capacity in terms of improving the governance of the Economic and Monetary Union which still has a long way to go both internally and externally I hope that in the next debate the Commission can present you with a full analysis of how the Economic and Monetary Union is functioning and how it should function on the tenth anniversary of the decision to launch the euro in May 2008 Mr President Commissioner let me start by thanking the rapporteurs Mr Mitchell and Mr Rosati for their work With single monetary policy set by the ECB and the euro as a single currency the Member States in the Eurozone have achieved the highest conceivable level of integration in the area of monetary policy Unlike the common monetary policy economic policy is not set at Community level and so economic policy decisions remain in the hands of the national governments and parliaments P A high level of longterm economic convergence within the Eurozone countries is a prerequisite for a strong stable European currency So I am delighted by what Mr Juncker and Mr Trichet have said today A lot has been published in the press over recent weeks and even at the start of this week It can be summarised in just one line the mountain laboured and gave birth to a mouse P I am pleased that you have been so clear and firm in your statements but I think that discussions will continue on how the euro and the criteria that shape it will develop in future This discussion will require all participants to stick firmly to their guns P As a representative of the younger generation I would urge all Member States in the Eurozone not to give up on their efforts to consolidate and to apply budgetary discipline in their national budgets In this context I would like to quote Montesquieu who said that what counts is applying the spirit of the law The terms of the Treaty on economic and monetary union must be respected even if the governments have changed Here Montesquieus excellent advice should definitely be applied lock stock and barrel For example if one Member State that has produced a lot of inflammatory material in the last few weeks were to change tack then other more northerly Member States would follow suit with disastrous results for consolidation and budgetary policy in the European Union P For that reason Mr Juncker and Mr Trichet I urge you to be tough to stand firm do not allow anyone to alter your course in the coming years Mr Schwab it is of course particularly appropriate to quote Montesquieu in this case on behalf of the PSE Group FR Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I cannot resist the urge to react to the remarks made by Mr Juncker and his evening visitor by first recommending that he ought not to let himself be taken advantage of by this evening visitor especially with regard to the nature of the deficits that he is in the process of examining closely in France That said in passing these deficits have nothing to do with new investment in research development and innovation as the Lisbon Strategy suggests but are basically due to a EUR 14 billion tax reduction targeted at the most welloff people in France a reduction that prompts most economists to wonder about its supposed positive knockon effect on EU growth I shall digress no longer P At present I should like to thank Mr Mitchell for his report and the work he has done in this regard within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs This report makes some important progress and advances not least in terms of transparency in the work and decisions of the European Central Bank and of the democratisation of appointment procedures This text also calls for more caution regarding a possible rise in interest rates in order not to jeopardise growth it calls for caution too regarding hedge funds so as to enhance surveillance and regulation in the interests of financial stability and transparency Finally we can be pleased with the consensus that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been able to reach on the need to invest huge sums in research education and training P That being said I would return to the issue of exchange rates because contrary to the fatalism and to the prevailing ultraconservatism we would like to point out that the instruments with which we can take action do exist Article 111 of the Treaty merely stipulates that I quote in the absence of an exchangerate system in relation to one or more nonCommunity currencies the Council acting by a qualified majority either on a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the ECB or on a recommendation from the ECB may formulate general orientations for exchangerate policy in relation to these currencies That is what we are asking you for Mr Juncker Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia general orientations for exchangerate policy in relation to the currencies of our major partners and competitors rather than a general laissezfaire policy and not very credible declarations on the lack of economic impact of a largely overvalued euro P Finally I should like to say a few words about an issue on which there is major disagreement between the two sides of this House wage policy Like you Mr Juncker we note that the share of wages in the GDP of the Eurozone keeps on falling and that at the same time the wages golden parachutes and other stock options of the directors and managers of large companies are a real provocation for European workers whose purchasing power is weakening P Like you Mr Almunia we are calling for a legal minimum wage in every EU country or at least in the Eurozone Encouraging the social partners to agree on significant wage increases as the social partners of Germanys metallurgical industry have done means not only aiming for a better distribution of the fruits of growth but also in our view helping to perpetuate growth by giving households more confidence and by increasing consumption",

natural disasters we witnessed in Europe this year come to prove the need for two substantial changes in the way in which we tackle these problems In the first place there is a need for the establishment of more flexible mechanisms to assist countries in the process of recovery after natural disasters Secondly these problems reveal the need for the establishment of integrated European rapid response forces to supplement the capacity of nations facing such disasters P This year my country Bulgaria suffered from both fires and floods When massive fires had to be extinguished around one of the big cities Stara Zagora the government requested help from the Member States of the European Union but could not receive it because their capacity was busy Instead it received support from Russia on the basis of a bilateral agreement That badly affected the image of the European Union in my country Therefore I am asking all of you to appeal to the European Commission to make a thorough analysis and draft proposals for the establishment of joint European forces to assist the Member States in their response to disasters and accidents Thank you Mr President international terrorism represents the dark side of globalisation Terrorists abuse the democratic freedoms granted by our countries such as free travel media coverage and citizens rights to attain their aims through fear and violence against innocent people P Addressing this problem calls for an effort to fully uncover and understand the intimate mechanisms of terrorism including its religious societal and even civilisational roots We in the democratic states start with a handicap in this area While we strive to save lives terrorists want to cause as many casualties as possible in the hope of being able to manipulate the emotion generated by the images of carnage shown on our television sets P We need to distinguish between the suicide bomber and his or her recruiter Very often the suicide bomber is not driven by the hate which characterises his or her recruiter but by the promise of perpetual happiness after an heroic death which is politically exploited by the recruiter P Prevention is better than having to react To that effect we need to strike the right balance between the immediate and longerterm requirements of the fight against terrorism We therefore need to strengthen intelligence police and judicial cooperation between our states while simultaneously addressing the structural causes of terrorism especially in the countries providing the most recruits for such acts RO Mr President after tens of years of political imprisonment the members of the Ilaşcu group in the Republic of Moldova have recently been invited to the European Parliament and were heard by the SubCommission on Human Rights Adrian Ivanţoc Tudor Petru Popa and Alexandru Leşko spoke tearfully about the torture they endured in the Transnistrian prisons and about the repeated abuses and violations of human rights that occurred there They called on the European Community to take more action to solve the regional conflict with a view to implementing all international agreements especially those providing for the retreat of Russian troops from Transnistria In order to turn these legitimate wishes into reality the European Parliament should rally and also rely on the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights when it proposes actual measures to support NGOs in Moldova should encourage and support the publishing of newspapers and magazines in this area and should build a broadcasting network on the right bank of the Nistru in order to ensure that Moldavian national radio and TV channels can be received Last but not least there is a desire to radically change how the Transnistrian problem is being negotiated The European Union and also Romania as a member of the Union must change the status of observers to full member status PL Mr President a few months ago the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning xenophobia and burgeoning nationalism in Europe The treatment meted out in that document to certain countries including Poland was unduly harsh and out of all proportion to the scale of the problem P Of course issues relating to racial hatred must be treated very seriously indeed That is why I am surprised that the European Commission is not taking decisive action against parties of a fascist nature that are in the ascendant in some countries There are even countries where representatives of such parties hold elected office at regional level Hit squads from those parties are abusing foreigners on the streets and making public appeals for borders to be revised P This is a serious problem mainly affecting a number of countries of the socalled old Union The countries concerned should have dealt with the problem long since yet the Communitys leaders are pointing the finger at the new Member States even in the case of insignificant incidents ES Mr President on 12 August there was a collision in the Strait of Gibraltar between the New Flame cargo vessel and the Torm Gertrud oil tanker This is the ninth accident in one of the worlds busiest shipping lanes used by over 100 000 vessels per year P The accident points to the pressing need to create a supervision and monitoring port authority between the Kingdom of Spain the United Kingdom and Gibraltar The fact that this kind of shipping control does not exist puts lives in jeopardy and logically constitutes a threat to the local environment P To date we still do not know and I feel the European Commission should demand to know what the sunken cargo ship is carrying 27 000 tonnes of scrap metal possibly hazardous contaminated scrap P I feel it is most important that Parliament and the European Commission urge the authorities in Spain State the United Kingdom and Gibraltar to create this shipping supervision and monitoring body Mr President I wish to draw attention to an innovation in European marine conservation On Saturday Scotland became the first country in Europe to implement a voluntary scheme of realtime closures of fishing grounds with the aim of safeguarding cod stocks That scheme which was developed as a joint initiative between the new Scottish Government and the fishing industry will hopefully provide a template for future marine conservation projects I understand that the Scottish Government has engaged with its counterparts in Denmark and Norway with a view to learning from this particular project P The common fisheries policy has been nothing but a disaster for Scotland to date and I firmly believe that the future of fisheries management lies not in central control from Brussels but in direct cooperation between fishing nations The Scottish Government and the industry are to be commended for taking such an innovative approach on this matter I hope in the mean time that when it comes to the December Council their voluntary efforts will be taken into account recognised and rewarded PL Mr President the Nazi invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 was yet another act of violence perpetrated against my homeland More than six million Poles perished during the ensuing six years of war This represented 17 of Polands population which amounted to 35 million individuals at the time P Two weeks later on 17 September 1939 the Soviet Union also attacked Poland pursuant to the MolotovRibbentrop Pact Over 22 000 of Polands intellectual elite lost their lives shot in the back of the head by the Soviets who then occupied my homeland for many long years This explains why millions of my countrymen were so full of hope when we regained our independence Despite many fine words and Union slogans about equal rights and nondiscrimination however certain German politicians and sections of the German media are constantly attacking my homeland the people of Poland the Government of Poland and the Catholic media notably Radio Maryja This proves that aggressive antiPolish sentiment still persists P On the anniversary of the invasion of Poland and on behalf of the living and the dead I call for an end to this violence which could be construed as an attempt to achieve objectives it proved impossible to attain through war Thank you Reconciliation always remains an important task in Europe RO Mr President my intervention concerns the rights of the Romanians in Serbia and Bulgaria The territory on the right bank of the Danube in NorthWestern Serbia and NorthWestern Bulgaria including the area from the Ratan Mountains to the Danube and from Moravia Valley to Timoc Valley in Serbia and the Vidin region until Lom in Bulgaria is primarily populated by Romanians They form a minority of over 300 000 people living in more than 130 small and middlesized villages and 20 towns They are not recognized as a national minority they do not benefit from religious services and education in their mother tongue Romanian is not taught in their schools The Romanian language literature and history are studied under semiclandestine conditions in private homes The sole Romanian church in Mălăiniţa will soon be demolished The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia has drawn attention to the desperate situation of the Romanian people living there and to their right to preserve their national identity I hereby call upon the European institutions to urgently investigate this situation and to intervene for the Romanian minoritys rights in Serbia and Bulgaria to be respected RO Mr President Article 29 of the Treaty on the European Union defines terrorism as a serious crime In the Treaty on the European Union actions whose effects endanger peoples lives which promote violence and aim to intimidate the population qualify as terrorist offences What we have seen in Budapest with the establishment of the Hungarian Guard can be included within the scope of this definition On that occasion the leader of the Hungarian Guard made some fairly shocking declarations expressing his concerns regarding Slovakia and Romania two countries with Hungarian communities that could attack Hungary I think that such organisations and extremist actions encourage separatist movement within the minorities that have already autonomous trends and such a situation is not in accordance with the proper conduct of an EU Member State Such organisations should be dissolved and attitudes similar to those expressed by the Hungarian Guard should be forbidden and punished by law Therefore I take the liberty of calling on the leaders of the EU institutions to firmly condemn such attitudes and to ask the Agency for Fundamental Rights to draw up a report on the facts and to monitor the situation faced by the minorities living in Hungary FR Mr President in our various countries many dramatic situations bring us back to our European obligations Such is the case in my country where a cargo vessel has caused the death of a fisherman This leads us on to maritime safety and now the French know where the Republic of the Kiribati Islands is I would urge you to have a look at the atlas it is not very well known but this is a flag of convenience The European Union must in all urgency get tough on flags of convenience speed up legislation in the Erika III package invent an Erika IV package on the social matter of sailors training and working conditions and simultaneously arrange better coordination for action by our countries in the International Maritime Organisation P This is an old issue that rears its head at frequent intervals but many dramas bring us back to it I urge you Commissioner and the gentleman or lady representing the Council not in attendance to step up your efforts in this direction RO Mr President on 18October 2007 the European Commission will launch the EU AntiTrafficking Day I would like to welcome this initiative which will bring this sensitive and for the most part unknown issue to the attention of the European citizens with around 2 and a half million victims every year Therefore I would like to draw the attention once again to the fact that in order to have successful results in the fight against this phenomenon Member States should coordinate their efforts more efficiently Currently national laws do not allow this Yet Member States have available to them the 2005 European Council Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings which represents the most comprehensive legal instrument for fighting this phenomenon However until now only 18 of the 27 Member States have signed up to this Convention and only 3 Member States have ratified it That is why I am taking the liberty in asking the European Commission to request the power to sign the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings on behalf of the European Communities from the Council Mr President trafficking in human beings is a serious breach of human rights We now have to move from words to deeds It is time to act in order to make it easier to punish traffickers and to protect victims rights These victims are sold and resold treated as slaves in a modern Europe a Europe about which we are proud to say is based on respect for human rights PL Mr President I should like to begin by expressing my sincere condolences to the relatives of all the victims of the natural disasters in Greece and in other countries My heart bleeds for them I was myself affected by a disastrous flood 10 years ago so I am very well aware of what is involved P Unfortunately disasters will continue to happen The establishment of a European Rapid Reaction Force is therefore particularly necessary I strongly support the creation of such a force at the earliest opportunity It is strange that we express practically no opposition to the establishment of a whole series of European agencies even though there are now several dozen bureaucratic entities of that type When peoples lives are at stake however we always express countless reservations It is time to overcome the latter and set up European units modelled on the UNs socalled blue berets but wearing perhaps red or white ones instead These units would be tasked with protecting us against the continuing threatening onslaughts of nature rather than against human beings HU Life has rapidly proven the truth of the professionallybased arguments with which I along with my colleagues in the European Parliament have fought against the European Commission and its decision to end the maize intervention P The Commission was concerned that the intervention system could not be maintained because of the surplus in maize though market trends did not indicate this The Commission purchased at EUR 101 and it is now selling for twice that and so is profiteering considerably from the entire maize intervention while drought has struck Europe and livestock farmers have been short of grain This raises questions about the trustworthiness of the Union there is still available stock but multinational speculators are buying up supplies while honest livestock farmers are not able to get sufficient fodder for their animals This undermines trust in the European Commission and the European Union Mr President dear colleagues the Romanian Government decided that 25 November 2007 would be the date for European Parliament elections On that day we will assist in what is an historical moment one could say Romanian citizens will be able to directly vote for MEPs That day will be a test of our seriousness and of our commitments to being an EU Member State In Romania the election campaign will be a chance to hold discussions on interesting issues concerning the European Union the future of the EU the Constitutional Treaty the next enlargement internal reform the efficiency of the European institutions free access to the labour market These should be the issues debated during the election campaign and not politicised issues that are not included in the citizens daytoday agenda anticipated elections motion of nonconfidence unfounded political attacks In order to improve the quality of the debates during the preelection period and the election campaign I hereby call upon experienced MEPs irrespective of their political views to visit Romania during the period before the elections to include on the agenda for the European Parliament campaign those European issues that must be debated in a consistent and serious manner both in Romania and in the other European countries FR Mr President I wish to inform you of the trial currently being held in Agrigente Sicily of seven Tunisian fishermen accused of aiding illegal immigration even though on 8 August they rescued 44 people including 11 women two of whom were pregnant and two children They are now accused of aiding illegal immigration and this is happening on European soil I feel that the crime of solidarity that is now taking place as this trial demonstrates ought to be condemned by Parliament A delegation is also due to travel to Agrigente this Friday and I can only encourage the Members and their leader you Mr President to voice their support for these seven Tunisian fishermen Mr President this week the Freedom Drivers return to Parliament The Freedom Drivers are people with disabilities and high dependency needs who want to enjoy the same freedom of movement that everyone else enjoys and that Europe represents They come to ask for the kind of legislation that will allow them this freedom of movement P They will explain the obstacles they face Many of these obstacles are of our making and removing them should be a challenge for this Parliament for the nations and the people we represent My challenge to you Commissioner is that this is their third year visiting and little has changed Yes we have improved air passenger rights but we have little else to say to them When can we expect the longawaited disability directive that will put real legislative weight behind equality for people with disabilities SK Prior to joining the Union some people in Central Europe thought that membership of the Union would solve all our problems That has not happened Although the Union was created to safeguard peace in Europe I must highlight the radicalisation of the situation in Hungary Members of the socalled Hungarian Guard took the oath a few days ago Its leaders talk about a common border for all Hungarians and its Memorandum of Association talks about compulsory weapons training They wear uniforms and enjoy the support of a former government minister SlovakHungarian relations have deteriorated recently P A few months ago the Hungarian Prime Minister refused to meet his Slovak counterpart and there is renewed talk about the revision of the outcome of World War II I call on the Hungarian Government to take action against the paramilitary guard and dissolve it We Slovaks have outlawed a similar radical organisation in our country There is no place for anything of this kind in the Europe of the 21st century Reconciliation and mutual apology are in our common interest Slovak and Hungarian Catholic bishops led by example in Ostrihom last year That is what saying no to extremism looks like in practice Mr President my colleagues and I recently witnessed a very strange phenomenon at Terminal 1B of Frankfurt Airport Passengers leaving for Sofia on a Bulgaria Air flight had to go through two consecutive security checks that were completely identical P After enquiring of the terminal officials why passengers had to stand twice in a long queue to undergo the same security check procedures I received the absurd explanation that Frankfurt Airport was overloaded and second checks were required because of extra passengers arriving from elsewhere P A reliable source later informed me that these double checks are applied on certain days of the week at Terminal 1B for flights to the following EU countries Bulgaria Poland and Romania P Mr President I would expect the Commission to respond to this practice because it has to do not just with air passengers rights but also with the human rights of European citizens RO In the Accession Treaty to the European Union Romania undertook to organise elections for the European Parliament by the end of this year The Romanian Government unfortunately postponed the initial date for the European Parliament elections that is 13 May until 25 November Analysts say that the main reason for this postponement was fear of certain political parties including the governing parties concerning the outcome of these elections An old Romanian proverb says you can run but you cannot hide” The Romanian Government is afraid not only of these elections but also unfortunately is afraid of women There is no woman in the Government and this is something particular in the EU Member States Among the current 35 Romanian MEPs 12 are women After the November elections the political parties should be able to change the gender ratio and they should designate at least 18 women in the European Parliament I would like to assure you that the Democrat Party as a member of the European Popular Party will act in this way Therefore I would like to remind the Romanian Prime Minister that Romania is part of the European Union as of 1 January and that 2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All PL Mr President last Friday Polish trade union members from the Gdansk shipyard demonstrated in front of the European Commissions headquarters in Brussels P In July the European Commission issued an ultimatum giving Poland one month in which to submit plans to reduce the shipyards production capacity The Commission is calling for the closure of two of the three slipways at Gdansk if the shipyard is not to be required to return the State aid it has received from the Government of Poland since 1 May 2004 The EU Commissioners claim that the Commissions intention is to modernise the shipyard not close it In fact such a drastic reduction of production capacity with the closure of two out of the three slipways would make the facility unprofitable In practical terms it would result in the loss of a great many jobs and ultimately in the collapse of the shipyard P The Gdańsk shipyard is not however simply an ordinary shipbuilding facility employing a great many workers It is also one of the most important symbols of the contemporary history of Poland and of our united Europe namely the birthplace of the Solidarity movement P The European Parliament ought to urge the European Commission to seek an appropriate solution to this situation one that would give priority to the good of the facility and of its workers In our role as the voice of European society we should express our solidarity with the shipyards workers and insist on a solution ensuring both the shipyards stability and respect for this symbol of the history of contemporary Europe Mr President Amnesty International is an organisation with impeccable credentials which through its many years of hard work has helped greatly in the fight against human rights abuses worldwide and has earned the respect of all those who care about justice freedom and democracy But Amnesty International has also not unexpectedly created a lot of enemies One such enemy exists in Turkey Many of Amnesty Internationals reports concern Turkey and this has upset the armycontrolled deep state establishment in that country P That establishment recently reacted aggressively once again As you are probably well aware it has issued through the local authorities in Constantinople a decision on socalled illegal fundraising and subsequently frozen Amnesty Internationals bank accounts in Turkey This is clearly an attempt to cripple Amnesty International in that country P I urge you to make strong representations to the Government of Turkey to make it clear that Parliament will not accept the aforementioned attack on Amnesty International and that such attacks hinder significantly Turkeys progress towards EU accession Mr President how much does membership of the European Union cost Britain Last week I published my second annual report on that very subject By calculating the direct and indirect costs I established that EU membership costs Britain at least GBP 601 billion per annum gross or GBP 506 billion per annum net That equates to over GBP 1 000 gross or GBP 843 net for every man woman and child in the UK Put another way that is GBP 114 000 per minute gross or GBP 96 000 per minute net The majority of the British people realise that this is a colossal waste of money P It is no wonder that UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is refusing to give the British people a referendum on the new reform treaty If he thinks that the EU is value for money he should accept my challenge and commission an independent costbenefit analysis to prove it That would be the prudent thing to do SK The prefab blocks of flats in the V4 countries and in Bulgaria and Romania were built 40 years ago and are in need of renovation It is not possible to get money from the Structural Funds because of the de minimis rule Under this condition without the approval of the European Commission a single beneficiary is not allowed to receive from the State a grant exceeding EUR 200 000 approximately 68 million Slovak crowns over a threeyear period The prefab estates are managed by only a few groups housing cooperatives or administrators The average cost of renovation is 580 000 Slovak crowns for one prefab house and approximately EUR 17 000 for one flat The new Member States would benefit if the Commission did not apply the de minimis rule in certain instances P At the end of June the ministers of these countries agreed to set up a group of experts which will be involved in talks with the Commission Its task will be to harmonise the legislation with the conditions for receiving EU financing for the renovation of prefab housing under the Structural Funds Prefab houses are the main urban renovation problem in the new EU Member States Since they are in a state of serious disrepair I am asking the European Commission and you my fellow Members to support this initiative Mr President I should like to draw the attention of the House to the tragic fire at the Penhallow Hotel on the seafront of Newquay Cornwall in my constituency P Three people died in the fire one because he jumped from a high window and two one of whom is rumoured to have been disabled died in their rooms These people would probably not have died if they had lived elsewhere in the European Union In Hungary for example a hotel of this height would have been required to have had sprinklers fitted In the last four years 60 people in Europe have died in fires in hotels where no sprinklers were fitted no one in Europe has died in a fire in a hotel where sprinklers have been fitted P I ask the Commission to take this fact into account and to bring forward proposals in terms of fire safety legislation for hotels across the Union IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen during the last parliamentary term our Radical Party colleague Maurizio Turco asked the European Commission some questions about the tax privileges of the Catholic Church and companies revolving around it in Italy and Spain P The Commissions answers to the request for information reached Italy just a couple of weeks ago In Spain the questions led to VAT legislation being amended in such a way as to do away with those advantages and privileges P In Italy on the other hand a series of absolutely unseemly reactions ensued some people including former minister Maurizio Gasparri went so far as to speak of Bin Ladenstyle actions while others have talked about anticlerical racism Even the VicePresident of the European Parliament Mr Mauro has referred to the antiCatholic and antisocial arm of the Radical Party Minister Mrs Bonino P In my opinion this House should be pleased if for once questions to the European Commission have had such a tangible effect and I believe that we should continue our support for this initiative NL Mr President you may know that a peaceful demonstration against the Islamisation of Europe was due to have taken place on 11 September in Brussels Citizens from several Member States wanted to organise this action and the demonstration aimed first and foremost to appeal to the European institutions in general and to Parliament in particular That is why the appointed place was Luxemburgplein right next to the entrance to Parliament P Now however the socialist Mayor of Brussels has banned this demonstration outright This makes a mockery of freedom of expression and the right of free assembly This is not so much an internal matter for Brussels or Belgium but a matter that concerns us as Parliament and it would therefore be proper for you to register a protest against the ban on this demonstration in Brussels It cannot be that we in Europe promote basic democratic rights all over the world through the European institutions while in Brussels in the heart of the European Union these same basic rights are being trodden underfoot Mr President I rise with great regret because I have considerable admiration and respect for you However I want to protest at the fact that last week in the Parliament building in Brussels there was a conference allowed which was ostensibly dedicated to peace in the Middle East but which in fact transpired to be a onesided prejudiced biased unrepresentative attack on the State of Israel I am afraid it was in sharp contrast to what is actually happening in the region where very patient negotiations between the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian Authority are moving forward under American auspices P This conference as you know was not a conference of the European Parliament It took place in the Parliament building and it allowed the organisers to gain credit and our approval for what they said You were thanked personally for facilitating that conference I think we should reflect carefully before we do that again The European Parliament building is not a meeting house for every group that wants to have a protest at this or that problem throughout the world It certainly should not be allowed to be hijacked by those extremists who will never recognise that peace in the Middle East as elsewhere will only come by negotiation and not by the bullet and the bomb Mr Sumberg since you addressed the President of Parliament I should like first to thank you for your appreciative comments However I must make it clear that there are things that are not part of the competence of the President This was a decision of the Conference of Presidents and therefore I had to carry it out P The conference was organised by an institution of the United Nations Therefore it was not any institution but rather an institution of the UN I explained this in a formal letter to the Speaker of the Knesset and I have also explained it to the Ambassador As far as the President of the European Parliament is concerned I did not take part in it and I did not receive any of the speakers The conference was held in the European Parliament but the European Parliament was not responsible for it I think you should take that into consideration P DE I must now remind you however that the President who always tries to accommodate the Members of this House is now invoking Rule 144 This states that the President may call Members for a period of not more than thirty minutes I have always assumed that this was the minimum which is why I have always been generous in my interpretation of this provision It means that Mr Sumberg to my regret is now the last Member to be called However I hope that my answer to him has been informative and has explained the situation regarding this event more fully P That concludes the item",

the debate on the Council and Commission statements concerning the EURussia summit on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President we spoke about this at the Conference of Presidents and said that in view of the EU summit with Russia Mr Putins trip to Iran and the very real nature of the disputes that are taking place there it would surely be absurd for this Parliament to debate these matters and not adopt a resolution in which the position of Parliament is set out Who are we in point of fact We always want to have powers of codecision yet now when we have the opportunity to take a decision we choose not to P We are in favour of a resolution prior to the EURussia summit and if need be another resolution after the summit It is the duty of Parliament to scrutinise the Commission and formulate political guidelines and not simply to behave like a debating society on behalf of the ALDE Group Mr President it has indeed been the practice of this House in the past on matters of major importance such as the EURussia Summit to have a debate followed by a resolution There are many things that need to be said and many messages that this Parliament needs to send to those who will represent the Union at that summit We should indeed send a firm message to the Russians and a firm message to the people who will represent us at the summit with the beliefs of this House behind it My Group would therefore support that move P Applause on behalf of the PSE Group Mr President if nobody else is speaking against I will speak against P Those who are putting forward this motion for a resolution seem to believe that the debates of this House only matter if we adopt a resolution at the end of the debate They are actually devaluing the debate itself because all of them are outside negotiating the text of a resolution instead of being inside the House debating it The points they and others wish to make ahead of this summit can be made in this House by a very vigorous debate by people making articulate and intelligent points instead of going out and working all night in a drafting committee to add to the huge book that we write at the end of each partsession with pages and pages of resolutions P It is about time we changed our priorities and revalued the debates on the floor of this House I plead for Members to have vigorous debates in this Parliament P Parliament adopted the motion DE Mr President I am not noted for intervening to any great extent on points of order but we hold this debate every Monday at five in the afternoon I have started to wonder why we have another debate on matters of political importance on Thursday afternoons Maybe this very question could be discussed again by the parliamentary powers that be because we have this same discussion every time about whether some item such as a summit that some people are holding somewhere or other should or should not be added to the agenda I would very much welcome a question of this nature being placed on one of the agendas of the House Mr Bosch all of you all Members of this House are the powers that be As you will have seen those who sometimes regard themselves as such are subsequently outvoted here in plenary That is just the way of our democracy Thank you for your comments P Thursday P Regarding the debates on cases of breaches of human rights the EPPED Group has moved that the item entitled Uzbekistan be replaced by an item entitled Pakistan on behalf of the PPEDE Group Mr President I will speak on behalf of my Group As you will realise a few days ago there was the most monumental suicide bomb attack against the party with the returning Ms Benazir Bhutto with over a hundred civilians killed There has been the recent deportation by the Government of Pakistan of another returning civilian politician Nawaz Sharif All sorts of things have been happening in that very key strategic South Asian country which need to be urgently debated by this Parliament P I am not aware of any recent changes in the situation in Uzbekistan other than the fact that the Council is deliberating on whether or not to remove the travel bans on Uzbek leaders That pales into insignificance compared to what is going on in Pakistan so I would urge this House to support the need to debate the Pakistani situation on Thursday on behalf of the PSE Group DE Mr President it is always so difficult to decide between the pros and cons We were in favour of this motion and we could subscribe to it if we had an undertaking from the EPPED Group and other groups that Uzbekistan really would be put on the agenda and discussed at the next opportunity In other words changing the agenda should not mean losing sight of Uzbekistan and the developments that are taking place there Given such an undertaking we could support the motion That is surely a splendid compromise on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President there can be no doubt that Pakistan is a very important issue It is too important however to deal with it as an item in Thursday afternoons debate on breaches of human rights Discussing Pakistan is clearly not just a matter of examining humanrights violations but a real opportunity to debate aspects of EU foreign policy in that entire region P I believe we would do better to put Pakistan on our next agenda as a proper debate with the Council and the Commission because that in my view is what we need most The subject of Uzbekistan is of more immediate concern because the Council intends to lift certain sanctions today In the present situation I believe we should adopt the position that what is happening in Uzbekistan is a humanrights issue which dictates that sanctions should not be lifted That can be quickly decided on Thursday afternoon Pakistan is a very difficult and crucial foreignpolicy issue and should be placed on our next agenda P Parliament adopted the motion P The order of business was thus adopted",

    "input": "Framework directive on the sustainable use of pesticides Thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides The placing of plant protection products on the market debate The next item is the joint debate on P the report by Christa Klaß on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides C602462006 P the report by Irena Belohorská on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides and P the report by Hiltrud Breyer on behalf of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market C602452006 Member of the Commission EL Mr President first let me thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteurs Mrs Belohorská and Mrs Klaß for their exceptionally thorough work Thanks are also due to the Environment Public Health and Food Safety Committee to Mr Ebner and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and to Mrs Corbey and the Committee on Industry Research and Energy for the reports and view they expressed at first reading P Over the last thirty years the EUs policies and laws on the protection of public health and the environment have enabled us to make significant progress considerably reducing the risks of pesticides Current legislation however focuses on the one hand on approving and placing products on the market and on the other hand on monitoring product residues in food and animal feed Between these two points of focus no law covers the period when pesticides are used This however is the crucial stage during it human health and the environment are at risk P The monitoring programmes implemented in Member States have exposed traces of pesticides not only in food and animal feed but also in the environment itself in concentrations exceeding the limits values set by European legislation Additionally it has become clear that pesticides are an issue of serious concern to European citizens We ought therefore try harder to increase the protection of European citizens and our environment The thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides and the framework directive accompanying it are covered under the general heading of tackling the human health and environmental due to pesticides P The main elements of the Commissions proposal for a framework directive are as follows P Firstly each Member State will draw up national action plans establishing targets measures and timetables to reduce risks and dependence on pesticides P Secondly professional pesticide users who are mainly farmers distributors and advisers will need to have access to appropriate training This will teach them enough about the risks of pesticides and about using alternative means Public awarenessraising about the risks of using pesticides will also need to be increased P Thirdly professional equipment for pesticide spraying will have to undergo regular checks and be correctly maintained P Fourthly aerial spraying will be prohibited but Member States will retain the option to make exceptions in limited cases where aerial spraying is the only feasible solution P Fifthly special measures will be taken to protect the general public and vulnerable sectors of the population as well as water systems and geographical areas such as those of the Natura 2000 network Such measures may include among others creating buffer zones or prohibiting or restricting the use of pesticides P Sixthly and finally but just as importantly we must support agricultural techniques which have recourse to low pesticide doses This is to enable the implementation of integrated pest control which ought to become compulsory from 2014 P Other measures envisaged by the thematic strategy have been incorporated or will be incorporated shortly in other legislative acts These include a proposal to regulate the placing of plant protection products on the market The regulation will bring about an ever greater restriction of harmful active substances circulating in the market particularly through comparative assessment and adherence to the principle of substitution This is my colleague Mr Kyprianous proposal which we are also discussing this evening on the basis of the report drafted by Mrs Breyer P There is also a proposal to regulate the collection of statistical data on plant protection products This proposal is of crucial importance it establishes indicators to measure progress on risk reduction The proposal is now being discussed by the relevant Parliamentary Committee P There is also a proposed new directive laying down basic specifications for spraying equipment to be placed on the market The proposal will add to the existing provisions on the maintenance and regular inspection of spraying equipment P In conclusion Mr President let me stress how important an aspect of the proposed directive on the sustainable use of pesticides integrated pest management is This is a fundamental measure of the Commissions proposal it has been debated by the other parliamentary subcommittees P Nobody doubts that we must reduce dependency on pesticides and turn to more environmentally friendly alternative means of protecting plants and controlling pests Integrated management and pest control are the most effective way to achieve this goal It is thus particularly important that this element should be maintained in our proposal and should become compulsory in all Member States from 2014 Member of the Commission EL Mr President we shall be debating a really difficult but important issue today P let me first of all thank all those who have worked to make this debate possible today and especially the rapporteur Mrs Breyer P The subject has always been difficult A balance needs to be struck Protection of health and the environment need to be increased while procedures are simplified and administrative costs are reduced to allow for greater competitiveness and innovation I am convinced that the Commissions proposal will help achieve these two goals for it supplements the internal market It does this by setting up a system of flexible mutual recognition of zones and allowing Member States to take measures and to adopt restrictions in cases of special health or environmental hazards whether in throughout a Member State or in parts of it P Mr President ladies and gentlemen it is a fact that plant protection products play an important role in agriculture crop growing silviculture and market gardening I wish we did not need them because they certainly affect human and animal health and the environment We must therefore ensure that the relevant rules are effective and balanced P The legislation in force dates from 1991 On the basis of a 2001 report by the Commission on the legislations function and where it can be improved both the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals for the amendment to the directive I daresay nobody doubts the need for the existing legislation to be updated P Allow me to thank the interested bodies in all sectors and mention the vital contribution they have made in the framework of this proposals preliminary draft The Commission has also carried out a comprehensive impact assessment P The first priority is indisputably to achieve the highest possible level of protection for human and animal health as well as for the environment This will be achieved through a number of provisions establishing clear strict criteria for the approval of active substances giving a central role to the European Food Safety Authority in the assessment of active substances and obliging farmers to maintain files on the use of plant protection products to be made available on request to their neighbours and the water industry The Member States authorities will also have to intensify checks on the commercial exploitation and use of plant protection products and the Commission will examine and verify how effectively Member States are carrying out these checks Further experiments on animals will be banned outright So as to promote sustainable agriculture the safest alternative solutions will replace the most hazardous products The proposal will thus create a safer framework for the use of plant protection products in the EU and will reinforce measures to protect the environment P The proposal does the same as the Lisbon Strategy because it will also reduce administrative costs The procedure will be shorter and more efficient while more importantly I believe preserving levels of safety and protecting the health of the environment P The Member States will no longer be working in isolation because mutually recognising approvals will now be the rule rather the exception This will avoid dividing the internal market over plant protection products and stop splitting the market over agricultural products P The changes to data protection rules will lead to greater transparency and fairer competition without hindering research and innovation P The proposed regulation is one of the keys to the Commissions overall strategy in the pesticides sector It complements the proposal for a directive on the sustainable use of pesticides which has already been analysed by my colleague Mr Dimas P Finally let me to mention the large number of amendments which have been tabled This is hardly surprising for such a complex subject and perhaps we have not yet reached complete agreement in our views I am optimistic that we will shortly be able to do so the next stages of the procedure Meanwhile the Commission can accept certain amendments while rejecting others The complete list with the Commissions view on each amendment and the relevant explanation is available to Parliament and MEPs It is not for me to analyse every amendment separately here because there is certainly not enough time I ask for this list to be included in the Minutes of the sitting P Mr President ladies and gentlemen I look forward to a constructive and interesting debate rapporteur DE Mr President Commissioners Dimas and Kyprianos ladies and gentlemen I welcome the Commissions proposal for a framework for Community action to achieve sustainable use of pesticides and my remarks here today will be confined to that part of the overall package P This is a vast field in which a great deal of adjustment is still needed throughout Europe for the sake of consumers and users and particularly for the sake of the environment Differing rules in the European Union not only create divergent safety standards but are also confusing and distort competition P The possibility of pests destroying a whole years harvests is thankfully a thing of the past in Europe Today however we face new major challenges to which we must respond with a sound policy on plant protection The global population is growing and food is becoming scarcer worldwide Climate change has altered the conditions in which farming takes place new pests are appearing and natural disasters decimate harvests It is still essential today therefore to safeguard harvests and the use of plant protection agents helps to do that P With plant protection as with many other things in life it is the dose that makes the poison Whilst a sleeping tablet is a boon many sleeping tablets can be fatal Care must be taken to ensure that plant protection products are used properly and professionally because improper use is dangerous That is true not only on farmland but also in public spaces such as parks playgrounds sports fields pathways and railway tracks Information education and knowledge of the implications of pesticide use of its benefits but also of its risks are at the heart of this directive Sellers and users of plant protection agents must be trained and informed P By means of national action plans the Member States must ensure that plant protection products are used sustainably In so doing they must strive for consistency with other Community provisions Welltested and safe application machinery will ensure targeted plant protection the aim being to minimise any risk P An arbitrary percentage reduction across the entire range of plant protection agents runs counter to the aims of good agricultural practice and integrated pest management We need both these factors Commissioner Dimas and we shall continue to need good farming practice and integrated pest management because we need dynamism The stringent regulation on authorisation moreover has been reduced to absurdity Products with harmful effects must not be authorised at all it is not enough to cut their use by half If however plant protection agents have come through a stringent approval process reducing their use by a certain percentage across the board would be illogical Moreover no one has yet been able to explain to me precisely how such a reduction is supposed to be managed and quantified P The same applies to protection of the aquatic environment The arbitrary establishment of standard buffer strips next to water bodies serves no purpose A differentiated approach remains necessary here Buffer strips must be right for the geographical situation the soil properties and the plants that require protection This kind of approach has already been adopted in the instructions for use that come with the various plant protection products P You mentioned crop spraying from the air Commissioner For the steeply sloping vineyards along the banks beside the Moselle in my home area or indeed for the rice plantations in southern Europe there is no alternative In those places crop spraying from the air is indispensable The use of crop spraying helicopters however must be regulated Particular care is needed in sensitive areas such as parks and public or school playgrounds The use of pesticides there must be kept to an absolute minimum and nonchemical alternatives should take precedence In my opinion that could even mean sending out an entire school class to weed the school grounds P Banning plant protection altogether in areas that are home to particular species of flora and fauna would be inconsistent with the aims of habitat conservation Pesticides are actually essential if these habitats are to be preserved Plant protection products are expensive and no farmer will apply more than is absolutely necessary Additional taxes distort competition in the world market They would result in the purchase of cheaper products from outside the EU which would ill serve the cause of sustainability P We want the same protection and the same standard throughout the EU In many countries the proposed measures have typified good practice for some time For this reason harmonisation of the rules governing the use of plant protection agents is imperative which is why the Commissions approach is the right one It is up to all of us now and we can take this as an invitation to initiate a directive that keeps red tape to a minimum while matching our aspirations I ask for your support FR Mr President I have asked for the floor because I am not quite sure what is going on I took part in the discussions on these various reports in the Committee on the Environment but it seemed to me that what Mrs Klaß has just presented was not the report that the committee had approved unanimously but rather a reflection of her personal position I would therefore like to know whether we may hope for a more objective presentation of the Environment Committees position on this very important report rapporteur DE Mr President may I say to Mrs Isler Béguin that there was no unanimous vote in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety that we definitely took the opposite view and that most of my group opposed the position to which she refers I have certainly stressed that I support the Commissions proposal rapporteur SK The Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides being a nonlegislative political document that accompanies the directive responds to the fact that the risks of pesticide use are not decreasing Todays residue levels in food products exceed acceptable values 44 of fruit is contaminated with pesticides 55 of which contains the maximum residue level Excessive residues were even found in the fruit being sold in the European Parliament premises The aim of my report is to minimise the dangers and risks to health and environment that arise from the use of pesticides P Firstly I would like to stress that the use of pesticides is linked to the development of malignant tumours or immunological and other neurotoxic defects That is why I found it surprising unfortunately it was a bad surprise that in its text the Commission mentions only in passing the health risks posed by the use of pesticides in particular by their cumulative effect Pregnant women children and foetuses are the group most at risk Although I am in favour of protecting plants I think that first and foremost we have to protect peoples health There is clearly a connection with climate change Global warming will bring more pests we cannot continue endlessly to increase the amounts of pesticides used P The National Action Plans containing the Member States individual targets in terms of risk reduction are the most important part of the whole process I consider the proposal in which the Commission rejects the quantitative use reduction targets to be insufficient The phrase to reduce hazards risks and dependence on pesticides is imprecisely defined and will not prompt the Member States to lower the amount of pesticides used P The Thematic Strategy is a general text and does not offer a detailed solution for calculating the amounts However my colleagues and I propose the following for the directive a 50 reduction in the most dangerous substances that are if used in certain large quantities carcinogens and mutagens the use of biological pesticides and pesticides that present little danger does not have to be reduced at present the socalled frequency of application index will be used for other pesticides The individual characteristics of and conditions in each Member State will be taken into account It must be emphasised that quantitative indicators in the National Action Plans do not impose equal reduction of pesticide use on all countries They will take into consideration the specific geographical conditions and arable farming systems of the given country P It is true that an automatic reduction in quantity does not necessarily lead to risk reduction however it does so in many cases The Thematic Strategy and the directive must deal with both crop protection measures and biocides Protection of the aquatic environment from contamination by pesticides must be strengthened through the establishment of buffer zones along watercourses Although I support the ban on aerial spraying I accept that it will be possible to grant an exception under certain circumstances in the absence of a more viable alternative When aerial sprayings take place the general public will be informed by suitable means about the time of spraying the place and the substance used The Strategy is not directed against farmers I believe that all these measures can be taken without radical cuts in farmers budgets This was proved by the Danish experience All of us have to realise how important it is for farmers to be competitive and we have to make sure that their products will not be replaced by products of farmers from developing countries P To conclude allow me to express my opinion on the amendments I cannot agree with Amendment 4 which seeks to change the name of the entire Thematic Strategy Although I want pesticides to be used with care I think that we should leave the official name of the entire document as it is after all it is an official name in the Official Journal and I think that it is suitable I also want to mention Amendments 3 and 5 which deal with residential zones Amendment 3 proposes to add the term urban to me this means suburban zone and thus excludes those who live in rural areas The term residential zones is both vague and imprecise I also propose to amend paragraph 8 linguistically because the term practitioner is a bad translation in French it is even médecin I am going to finish Mr President and to conclude I would like to thank sincerely all those who worked on this report rapporteur DE Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I have the privilege of introducing a report that will offer Parliament the opportunity tomorrow to vote for a breakthrough towards greater health and environmental and consumer protection According to the Eurobarometer the use of pesticides is the foremost concern among European consumers and the Committee has taken that into account P More than 220 000 tonnes of pesticide are applied in Europe every year This represents 25 of global pesticide use on only 4 of the worlds farmland In our view the eradication of highrisk pesticides should be the core of this regulation These are pesticides which have carcinogenic mutagenic or reproductively toxic properties as well as those with neurotoxic immunotoxic or hormonal effects P This regulation would be a huge contribution to making pesticides safer but we must also incorporate rules for less dangerous pesticides The active substances that are most frequently discovered in concentrations exceeding the EU residue limits should not be marketed any more because they have thereby proved I am afraid to say that they are uncontrollable P We are also pleased that the substitution principle which already represented a crucial step towards better health protection when it was incorporated into the EC Chemicals Regulation is to be enshrined in the proposed regulation too because substitution is a particularly powerful stimulant of competition in the pesticides industry It is scandalous and nothing short of scaremongering to sound warnings that up to half of all pesticides could disappear from the market P May I thank the Commission for establishing such stringent substitution criteria for pesticides need to be improved tenfold They should and this is a proposal made by Parliaments Environment Committee be authorised for a period not exceeding five years The Commissions proposal however also regulates how we should deal with cases of resistance P Another key feature of the proposed regulation is better protection of sensitive groups As we know foetuses babies and children are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of hazardous chemicals For this reason I am pleased that the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety has proposed that decisions on the authorisation of active substances and the assessment of the risks they entail be made by reference to the more vulnerable groups in society P I am particularly pleased to be able to tell you that we have also introduced rules on labelling because food products that are not compliant with Directive 2006215 must carry an indication to that effect That is a giant step towards greater transparency for studies and in particular a study conducted by environmental NGOs in the parliamentary supermarket have shown just how risky products notably everyday products can be Measured values were up to 200 times higher than the levels normally prescribed for infant and baby food P Greater transparency for the sake of these vulnerable groups but also for consumers and people living near farmland means greater support for Europe as a whole too because there must be no more prodding about in the dark when it comes to traceability Reports lists of licensed pesticides residue readings and above all toxicological and ecotoxicological data must be made accessible to everyone almost in real time and local residents must be informed of imminent cropspraying through a central information system The pesticide passport will make it possible to trace through wholesale and retail outlets which pesticide was used when That will create competition and consumers of course will be the main beneficiaries of competition between manufacturers producing only safe products P Another of our aims is that this regulation should ensure high environmental standards This is why the Environment Committee came out against the idea of dividing Europe arbitrarily into three zones that are not based on any environmental or climatic criteria or on landscape types Moreover Commissioner the idea did not win majority support in the Council Like the Council we advocate better voluntary cooperation in Europe on product licensing Let me also reiterate that there are strong legal reservations because no intergovernmental agreements exist within these zones to enforce mandatory mutual recognition of pesticide licences Such provisions exist in the EU context on the basis of the European treaties but there is no legal framework for mutual recognition within the defined zones P People in Europe do not want poison on their plates I hope that this regulation will also improve Europes standing as a business location because it will make Europe a better place for consumers to live and it will be universally beneficial not only to the environment and consumers and in terms of animal welfare but above all to manufacturers and farmers since they will receive more incentives to innovate and become more competitive P In conclusion I would like to express my warmest thanks to the shadow rapporteurs who have collaborated on this report in a truly cooperative manner I hope that this new pesticides regulation will enable us to raise health and environmental protection to new heights in Europe Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development Mr President we have to face up to the very practical idea that we need to produce food in Europe last month we reduced setaside to zero to bring 10 of land back into production and we need the necessary tools to do that job P We are all quite happy to want safe food and safe chemicals but and the Commission is dealing with this in the right way this has to be done on a riskbased system similar to that used for REACH if a chemical is safe to use then it can be used but if it is not safe to use then it should be taken off the market That is how we should deal with this the whole way through P Climatic conditions make a great deal of difference to when you should spray so you need flexibility in when and how you spray There are now satellite systems which can introduce the spray at the right time and you can actually reduce the amount of spray and chemical you use Take for instance this year which was an extremely wet year in many parts of Europe In my own country Britain you cannot buy organic potatoes because you could not spray them and could not keep the blight away from them There are therefore very few organic potatoes to be had We need the necessary tools and that is why we cannot go for a percentagebased reduction each year We have got to go for a sensible riskbased system P Also when it comes to the 10metre strips there are believe it or not chemicals that you can use in water courses There is a chemical called Roundup which can actually be sprayed on the banks of a river or a stream Are we going to ban its use on a 10metre strip next to a stream when it can actually be used on the banks of a stream Let us be sensible about this We need food security we need food production and we need safe food in Europe Let us all work together to achieve that draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry Research and Energy NL Mr President I think that one minute for two opinions is very short but all right I shall try and keep it as brief as possible P Pesticides are useful and necessary and without these products it is becoming difficult to feed 6 billion people Certainly there is still a great deal to be done to combat the harmful environmental and health effects of pesticides Bringing new products onto the market is a long and always expensive process It is good for the industry that approvals can be dealt with more quickly but Parliament is rightly asking that Member States should have the right to refuse products in their territory P The industry is focusing increasingly on the major crops the big five rice corn maize soya beans and cotton because with those they can recover a lot of the cost But it is of course important for the minor crops to be properly protected and the Committee on Industry has made a number of good suggestions for that The Committee is also making a number of good suggestions to introduce incentives to switch to more sustainable products That is also very important P I have another comment to make on the use of pesticides The compulsory buffer zone of 10 metres from surface water is not a good idea for some Member States I therefore welcome the amendment tabled by the PSE Group on that point Surface water is now one of the assessment criteria for approval and on that basis Member States have the right to establish a buffer zone for products themselves P All in all I think that this is a balanced and workable position for Parliament draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs ES Mr President the Commission proposal on this report had a dual legal basis namely Article 372 on agricultural policy and Article 1524b on health protection P The Committee on Legal Affairs has studied these proposals For example a proposal was made by the Committee responsible to remove Article 372 and incorporate Article 1751 by removing Article 372 retaining Article 1524b and adding Article 1751 P The key aspect as far as the legal basis is concerned is for the debate to be geared to the aim and content and the Committee on Legal Affairs is of the unanimous opinion that the applicable article is Article 1524b there being no need to refer to Article 1751 P In our view this is perfectly clear and there is no need either for the twofold legal basis proposed by the Commission or for the twofold legal basis proposed by the Committee responsible all that is required is a reference to Article 1524b because the purpose of this proposal for a directive is the protection of human health draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection DE Mr President as draftswoman of my Committees opinion for the Breyer report concerning the Regulation on the placing of plant protection products on the market I should like to comment on the proposal P In this proposal for a regulation it is important that we should strike a balance between the following interests on the one hand there are the interests of consumers in healthy food without residues in other words in safe plant protection products that do not endanger public health and the environment and in clean drinking water on the other hand consumers also have an interest in a reliable supply of fresh and affordable products and they want homegrown fruit and vegetables rather than those from countries outside the EU given that there are scarcely any checks on the pesticides that have been used those countries P Our farmers need certain plant protection products if they are to combat resistance That cannot be done however without a certain number of protection products At the same time they want safe riskfree protection products This is why we also believe that demonstrably carcinogenic substances must be banned As regards the other licensing criteria however we intend to rely on scientific evidence and base our approach on maximum values That is a balanced midway position that protects our consumers while guaranteeing that homegrown fruit and vegetables are affordable as well as being subject to adequate testing P As far as informing neighbours is concerned if we have stringent licensing criteria and if we test plant protection products properly I cannot see why we have to go through bureaucratic procedures to alert neighbours and local residents to the use of plant protection products when they have not even asked for information What are consumers supposed to make of such information How in practice are farmers supposed to inform all their neighbours and all residents of the local area before they apply plant protection products It is for these reasons that I argue passionately against the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety which would impose this very requirement and I also advocate rejection of the Commissions proposed public information clause at this point for if we have safe plant protection products we have no need for these bureaucratic procedures P Let me make a very brief comment on the zonal approach We are seeking greater harmonisation That is the main point for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection too The provisions proposed in the Breyer report would result in 27 national licensing zones Our aim after all is harmonisation with due regard to the opinions of the Member States which could adapt this authorisation to their own conditions of use I therefore urge the House to support this harmonisation effort and to back the Commissions zoning proposal draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development FI Mr President the subject being discussed the use and placing on the market of sustainable pesticides is a very important one It embraces both the practice of sustainable agriculture and matters of public health It is therefore regrettable that the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development should not be taking part in this debate right now P Over the millennia mankind has had to contend with pests vermin weeds and plant and crop disease They have reduced harvests and rendered them unfit for human consumption In recent decades the struggle has been overcome to some extent mainly on account of new plant protection products At the same time however there has been a threat to health P The proposals for a directive now before us are very rigid Generally speaking the purpose of the new regulations is to improve the situation regarding public health However no clear analytical illustration of the dangers of plant diseases and weeds which pesticides are used to try and prevent has been put forward This is a huge drawback because in this case what is best may not be what is right The sustainable practice of agriculture could be set back years Not using pesticides is not necessarily a good option even as far as public health is concerned on behalf of the PPEDE Group FR Mr President this is an important complex and tricky subject that we are debating today Combating the pests that devour and damage crops is a necessary challenge in terms of both food security and the protection and improvement of our environment P Sensible recourse to pesticides is therefore unavoidable It is essential however that the associated risks should be assessed in a balanced way particularly with regard to human health and that measures to scale down pesticide use should be properly planned The motion for a resolution on a Thematic Strategy is in my view a helpful response to the crucial questions that we face and I should like to pay tribute to our rapporteur Irena Belohorská and to record my appreciation of the close cooperation that went into the drafting of the text P Certain comments are called for the core problem of risk management is inseparable from the question of how much pesticide is used The elimination of the use of toxic or extremely dangerous substances needs to be established as a firm principle In respect of other pesticides we have to apply subsidiarity Working within a common European framework it will be the responsibility of the Member States to set their own national targets timetables and criteria for reducing the quantities used National action plans will also facilitate adaptation to particular circumstances in each country It is extremely important too to protect the aquatic environment and we must be rigorous here by establishing buffer zones fixed in accordance with local conditions P Finally I would point out that the system we wish to implement is a logical followon to the REACH directive With regard to pesticide quantities the thrust of our argument should be as little as possible and as much as necessary on behalf of the PSE Group DA Mr President my British fellow Members sometimes use the expression An apple a day keeps the doctor away This is the way it should be Fruit and vegetables are normally healthy types of food but unfortunately this is not always the case In far too many cases there are pesticide residues on fruit and vegetables and naturally this has direct negative consequences for human health The subject that we are concerned with here is therefore very important Consequently it is very important that we use these substances in a sustainable manner so that we can reduce their usage in those cases where we use too many pesticides Our nature environment and health are being damaged and groundwater sources may also be contaminated P Therefore I also believe there is reason to criticise the Commission particularly because you Mr Kyprianou are known in my country too as a man who is very concerned with consumer interests and have done a considerable amount to safeguard the environment and health I do not understand how you can stand here today and defend a proposal from the Commission concerning zone division that will force European countries to lower their environmental protection levels and will also force European countries to reduce their levels of consumer protection P Allow me simply to give a couple of examples of what this will mean if we accept the proposal that you have put forward In Denmark around 100 types of pesticide are permitted We have reduced the use of pesticides by around 50 since the beginning of the 1980s I am sure you will agree that this is a very sensible thing to do If your proposal is implemented we will be forced to double the number of pesticides permitted in Denmark Double the number of pesticides This will probably mean that we will find it very difficult to continue drinking our groundwater untreated as we do today P I do not view this issue purely as a national one I speak on behalf of the entire Socialist Group in the European Parliament and fortunately also on behalf of the vast majority who made their views clear through the vote in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety There are many examples In every single zone it is of course the case that every country apart from one will be forced to approve pesticides that they do not currently approve Let me give an example of one crop maize In the UK a maize pesticide is used that contains around 15 active substances In Hungary 57 active substances are used while in Poland 37 are used However if the Commissions proposals are implemented every country will therefore approve pesticides that could contain up to 57 active substances This means that in the UK the level will be quadrupled It should not be the EUs task to force countries to use more pesticides It will affect the environment it will affect health and it will affect groundwater Surely this cannot be the intention P I hope that you will back up what we have proposed in the Committee on the Environment this will also make life easier for the industry It is in the compromise that we have adopted in the Committee on the Environment we will say no to the mutual obligatory approval of pesticides but yes to the mutual obligatory approval of data Moreover we are talking not only about zones but also about data throughout Europe This will make life much easier for the industry At the same time we are actually giving countries the right to say no if they have climatic conditions that require them to do so P Finally with regard to the reduction targets I would like to say to Mr Dimas that it is unbelievably positive that we are getting rid of the most dangerous substances substances that cause cancer substances that affect child development etc Naturally we would like to remove these substances from the market They are also completely unnecessary In addition I think that we should go a step further and also establish a general reduction target for all substances Of course this should be something that is determined individually in each country but if we simultaneously link this with the European reduction targets of around 20 I think we are being ambitious However in spite of everything I still believe we are at a stage where it is possible It will be of great significance for health and the environment in Europe P With regard to the justification that has been used by the Commission for not introducing these reduction targets we have introduced a treatment frequency index that takes account of the points that you have otherwise emphasised on behalf of the ALDE Group FR Mr President Members of the Commission ladies and gentlemen it is true that a number of Member States have already initiated measures to reduce pesticiderelated risks but trends in pesticide use differ from one country to another For example certain substances the use of which is banned in some Member States are none the less on sale in those states because their use is permitted in other states There is a clear need to harmonise the rules here in order to ensure that the same conditions apply throughout the Union The ALDE Group advocates strict control of pesticides whilst recognising that their use is both a necessity and a reality P We have a number of amendments that are intended to make the text more easily applicable while sticking to the principle that safer or nonchemical alternatives should be encouraged My group is keen to focus the volumereduction targets on dangerous substances We cosigned an amendment to Article 4 on national action plans setting as the EUwide target a 20 reduction in frequency of application within 10 years and 50 rates of reduction for dangerous substances by 2013 P Some may think it paradoxical that my group has tabled a further amendment also to Article 4 offering Member States the option of an approach based on risk reduction This is in fact a more realistic approach but the calculations are more difficult than they are with volume reduction We thought it was important to put forward this amendment because the question is one that we would wish to see addressed in the interinstitutional discussions after the vote at first reading P I should now like to consider a few specific points For the protection of watercourses it would seem more logical to take measures tailored to the geological environment rather than fixing a minimum bufferzone area It is legitimate to seek to protect specific living spaces such as parks childrens playgrounds and school areas because the use of pesticides in proximity to such areas should be restricted to the minimum necessary or indeed be prohibited and nonchemical methods should be prioritised P On the fraught question of aerial spraying the European Commissions proposal for a ban in principal with exceptions that must be justified made a lot of sense The text from the Committee on the Environment is however acceptable Whilst I understand the need to notify the public of pesticide spraying I think it has to be left to the Member States to determine the nature and extent of the notification and the means of giving it We are dealing here with so many different types of terrain and so many different approaches that any attempt to standardise seems unrealistic P The ALDE Group is thus seeking to achieve a balance the essence of which is that no single party whether user or manufacturer should be penalised but rather that rigorous and consistent legislation should be introduced allowing pesticide users to protect their crops allowing manufacturers to sell products that will gradually become less harmful and allowing consumers not only to eat safe food but also to live in a safe environment on behalf of the UEN Group PL Mr President the three reports that have been presented are inextricably linked The European Union is trying to do as much as possible to reduce the negative impact of pesticides on the environment and to prevent their accumulation in the soil in water and in plants A great deal has been done in the last few years to minimise these effects A particularly important role in this work has been played by research organisations that have created modern preparations that work more selectively However we should remember that in past years the quality of pesticides was much worse they were used in much higher doses many times higher and as a result the pollution in our environment is a consequence of activities in years past For this reason in addition to the new directives we must supplement existing legislation with a directive on the deactivation and disposal of outdated pesticides P I would ask for your active participation in this matter since despite the passage of some years problems are still increasing instead of decreasing and the risks are increasing instead of decreasing as was shown at the last NGO forum in Kishinev on behalf of the VertsALE Group FR Mr President Commissioners whilst I should like to congratulate Ms Breyer on the excellent outcome she has achieved I cannot support those who defend the use of pesticides because it is absolutely vital that we rid our environment and our bodies of these dangerous substances I hope that the European Parliament may in future support the most forwardlooking positions on this question instead of yielding to the latest siren calls from manufacturers representing a deadly industry Eliminating carcinogenic mutagenic and reprotoxic pesticides and substances that weaken our nervous and endocrine systems and damage our immune systems is an entirely healthy aim P We should also welcome our fellow Members efforts to ensure transparency in the provision of information for consumers who are the innocent victims of these dangerous substances Surely Commissioners it is high time that action was taken Never before have insecticides fungicides and herbicides of various types been used as systematically as they are used today To look no further than France a situation that can only be described as joint management of public policy on pesticides by the state and the chemical industry has succeeded thus far in marginalising ordinary peoples expectations about public and environmental health regardless of research findings on environmental toxicity and at the expense of statistical studies if they establish links between chemical substances and pathological conditions all this despite recent warnings from the medical profession via the Paris Appeal for example and the Grenelle Forum on Environment in France The industry is doing its utmost to play down the impact of pesticides P Thus after the pollution of water courses by the herbicide Atrazine which everyone has heard about and the decimation of bee populations the chemical industry is trying to draw a veil over the fact that France remains the European Unions number one pesticide user Every year between 70 000 and 80 000 tonnes of pesticides are poured into our environment in France So in relation to the pesticides package unlike the REACH directive the Members of this House will not allow themselves to be discredited Ordinary people expect no less of us that is clear from the mass of correspondence we receive calling for swift and strong action P We hear for example from people highlighting the dangers of inhaling pesticides that are sprayed by vegetable growers in the south of France and from others concerned about heavy use of herbicides in public parks and gardens prompting some to call for pesticidefree zones on behalf of the GUENGL Group CS Ladies and gentlemen I would like to commend the rapporteur Mrs Belohorská on her report on a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides P I believe that the rapporteur succeeded in preparing a document that makes provision for and strikes the right balance between the need for sustainable competitive agricultural production in Europe and promoting the use of pesticides only where there is minimum adverse effect on human health and the environment P I welcome the fact that the report incorporates the amendment on the precautionary principle regarding human health and safeguarding of the land and water ecosystem which I coauthored P Like the rapporteur Mrs Belohorská I too regret that whilst the most important result to be expected from the thematic strategy is the reduction of adverse effects on human health deriving from pesticide use the strategy deals with this heath impact only marginally I believe that it will be up to the Commission to complete the work in this regard in the future P From the point of view of occupational health and safety I welcome the points in the report that highlight the need not only for adequate information but also for appropriate protective means and regular checks of application equipment P I believe that we have here an instrument with many concrete effective mechanisms to reduce and improve the safety of pesticide use on behalf of the INDDEM Group NL Madam President in the pesticides debate I have always tried to adopt a realistic and balanced position between environmental concerns on the one hand and the interests of producers and consumers on the other hand I should like to talk about several aspects of these reports in more detail P One of the proposals is that the policy should be based on reducing use I am very sceptical about this You can certainly reduce the total quantity of pesticides but often it is the most used pesticides that are the least dangerous In that case the risks are still more or less equal P I am much more in favour of a policy based on reducing the risk The Netherlands has been operating such a policy since 2000 and it has been found to reduce the environmental risk by 86 Another disadvantage of reducing use is that fewer different pesticides are available and resistance builds up more quickly P Another point is the introduction of buffer zones around watercourses An amendment to create a 10metre buffer zone has been approved in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety For a country with a lot of water like the Netherlands that 10 metres is a problem It means in effect that 35 of agricultural land cannot be sprayed P Finally I would like to point out that it is not only a standard that is important enforcement is undoubtedly important At the moment that is lacking as can be seen from the products intended for consumption we regularly come across that do not meet the standard even in the European Parliament on behalf of the ITS Group DE Madam President as we all know it has long been presumed that a connection exists between pesticides used in agriculture or genetically modified foodstuffs on the one hand and various diseases on the other When pesticides are even being found here and there in drinking water it is undoubtedly high time to make the slowgrinding wheels of EU bureaucracy turn faster P It remains to be seen how far we can actually go towards achieving the present aim of reducing the application of plant protection agents We are all familiar of course with ambitious aims that are not achieved in the end I do believe however that the intended replacement of carcinogenic substances is far from the great achievement it is volubly proclaimed to be on the contrary it is in my view an immediate imperative In actual fact the replacement of these substances is long overdue P If we consider that the EU accounts for one quarter of all global pesticide use even though it possesses only 4 of the worlds arable land the problem becomes immediately clear These statistics also show that our EU support schemes have patently been steering conventional agriculture in the wrong direction P There is of course a general suspicion among consumers and it is not entirely unfounded that resourceful farmers are trying to circumvent the prescribed ceilings with combinations of authorised plant protection products Given the lack of research into interaction between products it is high time for intervention to curb such practices Moreover the continual increases in maximum concentrations in recent years must be reversed in view of the greater danger posed to highrisk groups such as children P Importing organic products from the opposite ends of the earth is not only inconsistent with various environmental objectives but is also one of the causes of increased traffic volumes and a perennial indictment of the Unions misguided support policy Our support schemes should therefore be rethought particularly with a view to providing more support for those European farmers who refrain using pesticides If we choose instead to go on harassing farmers with bureaucratic obstacles no one should be surprised if they ultimately throw in the towel in frustration while Brussels is bewildered by the chronic dwindling of the farming community Madam President I am tempted to say that a political pesticide to deal with the rampant weed that is EU regulation would do us all a favour When I look at some of these amendments and proposals a proposal like the 10metre rule I detect within it a gross degree of overkill P I think we have to face some facts Without controlled use of pesticides in our agriculture we will drive more food production to less regulated regions of the world jeopardising quality and food safety Perhaps of even more interest to some without fungicides and herbicides to protect and cure disease in fine turf many golf and bowling surfaces would become weedinfested and unplayable P Yes pesticides must be controlled but our measures must be based on sound science and be practical at farm and street level The strident codes of practice governing the use in my country are I believe adequate and therefore I will vote against those dogmadriven changes which some would wish to impose FR Madam President Commissioner it is a pity that representatives of the agricultural sector have not been involved in this debate as it would have been extremely interesting in the light of the recent CAP reform to hear the farmers voice as well P The task we face is not only to safeguard the future of farming in Europe and the quality and quantity of food production but also to promote research and to ensure that data are protected The greatest challenge of course is to protect human health and to prevent toxic products from accumulating in our water and our environment We must also be concerned however with the health of farmers and their families who need better protection as it is they who come into direct contact with these products and the advice they receive is often the advice of the companies marketing the pesticides The companies are hardly likely to tell them that researchers have started asking questions about the link between exposure to pesticides and the steadily increasing incidence of certain conditions such as Parkinsons disease Alzheimers prostate cancer brain tumours and congenital deformities It will therefore be absolutely essential to establish strict rules for the placing of products on the market We should also encourage research through proper provision for data protection and promote research programmes on biological means of pest control a useful example of innovation At the end of the day these products should also be affordable for farmers P My final point Commissioner concerns the protection of bees the longterm evaluations provided for in Directive 91414 have not been carried out Simply having rules and regulations is not good enough they must be applied and systems are needed to ensure that they are applied I agree that the most important thing is to regulate the placing of these products on the market but I would also make the comment Madam President that in the course of this impassioned debate the intrusions of lobbying by the chemical industry although infrequent have been disgraceful FR Madam President Commissioners ladies and gentlemen all the health and environmental data now available which I do not propose to list this evening must necessarily prompt this House to take decisive action on pesticides and their conditions of use It is essential that such action is based on measurable targets It became clear in the discussions prior to the vote in plenary that there are major differences between the Member States in both their practice and their policy approach so we ended up compromising on certain issues and relying on subsidiarity I hope we shall not be deceived here by subsidiarity for it will entail flexibility that could easily become a pretext for watering down our policies to a very minimal expression of the political and public will being voiced here today particularly on the issues of exposure to risks and the extent of the buffer zones beside watercourses P If subsidiarity is to be meaningful in relation to pesticides it must encourage more comprehensive thinking about the agricultural and environmental issues in each European region That will mean stepping up research and the transfer of technologies involving all the stakeholders including farmers researchers NGOs health professionals and representatives of the food industry and carrying out thorough research in each geographical area jointly identifying best practices and nonchemical alternatives that are suited to the soil the climate and the crops There are a few regions in which this work is already being done P I therefore propose that the Commission should encourage the introduction of such an approach and should facilitate interregional exchanges of experience whilst at the same time ensuring that European laws are properly applied DE Madam President many of my fellow Members believe we need strict rules for dealing with plant protection agents and they are right but at the same time we must not ignore the impact of the legislation we adopt The fact is that plant protection products are an important element of modernday agriculture P Take the example of the regulation on authorisation We are in the process of banning entire clusters of active substances on the basis of exclusion criteria simply because of an abstract notion of hazardousness This approach ignores the actual risk involved in applying these agents down on the farm It leads us to ban active substances which do not pose any problem at all in practice As a result not enough active substances will be available in future to combat pests properly P If only a few active substances are used resistance to pesticides will develop more quickly There will be no reliable means left to deal with many pest problems And these are probably the new heights to which Mrs Breyer just referred When that stage is reached the security of Europes food supply will plumb new depths Instead of imposing blanket bans we should be providing for a reliable licensing procedure that examines the actual risk involved in the use of each substance P The next example relates to the strategic approach to this issue in which we argue for an acrosstheboard Europewide reduction target for the use of plant protection products That however has nothing at all to do with the risks involved in their use P The Commission had set targets for reducing the actual risk That is a good idea and we should retain it When all is said and done we should focus on what is feasible namely efficient pest control coupled with proper risk management After all it is also a matter of establishing how the growing need for raw vegetable materials is to be met in future P In the past innovative plant protection products have helped to make production grow faster than demand for arable land Our aim for the future should not be to reverse this situation LT I do not think you could find a single person in this House in this Parliament who would claim that ecology a healthy environment and human health was not important I do not believe that any European citizen would ever say that P However ladies and gentlemen while making decisions talking about legislation and making and implementing rules that hundreds of thousands of people would have to adhere to and that would no doubt have an impact on the lives of millions of people we cannot base our decisions on emotions and good intentions We need to achieve this objective in a balanced and sensible way One of the key objectives set out for the EU agricultural sector is to supply good quality food at affordable prices The EU is known for the high standards of food production and strict farming regulations it lays down for its Member States On the other hand there is constant pressure on EU agriculture to be competitive as well as to produce good quality food P We are in no position to ignore these factors when discussing plant protection regulations The opinion expressed by the Commission and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has satisfied the expectations of all interested parties Nevertheless the amendments proposed or those introduced at the time of the discussion in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety have raised serious concerns P If these amendments are accepted the consequences could be unpredictable They pose risks not only for agriculture and the food industry but also for nature itself Does it mean that genetically modified organisms will enter the EU market The impact on traditional crops would be huge if 90 of plant protection products were excluded from the market P Ladies and gentlemen once again I urge you to base your decision on sound scientific evidence and good practice not on rumours and emotions I hope that your vote will reflect the opinion of all interested parties and that the outcome will be balanced and correct so that agriculture is not destroyed EU citizens are not left without European food and millions of people do not end up unemployed in the name of environmental protection DA Madam President early tomorrow morning I am going to the grocers to buy bottled drinking water In many countries people do this because the groundwater sources have been contaminated by pollution The water is subject to chemical treatment as if it were a dirty coat Then it is chlorinated and tastes as bad as it is expensive In Denmark we have a rich vein of gold underground clean groundwater We drink it directly as drinking water without first sending it to a water treatment works It is healthier than bottled water it tastes better and it is much much cheaper P However this also means that we must watch over it and prohibit pesticide sprays in cases where the pesticide could enter the groundwater Therefore Denmark prohibits 13 types of pesticide sprays 12 of which are found in drinking water This is something that we would like to continue with and I therefore request that my fellow Members vote in favour of an amendment to permit protection zones We have already had the proposal adopted in previous regulations these must now be repeated in order to prevent them from being annulled Finally we have received support from a large majority here in Parliament and subsequently from the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso Thank you We have received no support from the Danish Commissioner for Agriculture who together with the Danish Minister for Food Agriculture and Fisheries also from the Danish Liberal Party Venstre would rather support the farmers opportunity to ruin our drinking water It is sad that the Danish Agricultural Council would rather support Venstre It is very shortsighted to pursue slightly higher corn yields and then have to pay billions of kroner in order to purify the groundwater The Treaty states that polluters themselves will pay I have proposed this in an amendment and I request that my fellow Members support the requirements of the Treaty Noone has the right to poison our common earth and drinking water ES Madam President Commissioners the proposal for a regulation drawn up by the European Commission to replace Directive 91414CE achieves greater harmonisation of authorisation procedures while at the same time providing for consumer protection However the result obtained in the Environment Committee not only fails to have regard to the objective of greater harmonisation but unjustifiably overhauls measures aimed at protecting the consumer and the environment P The report is based on a total lack of faith in the existing methods of agricultural production in the European Union Farmers however are not the only ones who will suffer consumers are likely to suffer as well because many crops will become unviable making imports necessary with a knockon effect for food security P Insufficient consideration has been given to the fact that the approval and use of plant protection products is already subject to strict controls both by the European Food Safety Authority and by the competent authorities of the Member States P Moreover this proposal changes the number of active substances from 1 100 as authorised in 1991 to 148 which are listed in Annex I to this proposal Of those 148 substances only 34 are insecticides nematocides or acaricides which are the substances most needed for cultivation in Mediterranean Europe where the level of attack by insects is the highest in the entire Union Insects are not only a menace to plants but are also transmitters of very serious human illnesses P The Commission proposal to divide the European Union into three zones for the mutual recognition of plant protection products should be reinstated Criteria for precluding pesticides must be based on proper risk analyses Without a risk analysis it is impossible to determine the effect of these substances on health or the environment P Finally I would like to point out that the dose makes the poison FR Madam President I have been stressing the importance of this evenings debate because what we have at stake here today is nothing less than our vision of Europes farming future and the need to move away from intensive agriculture that clearly causes too much pollution towards sustainable agriculture that will respect biodiversity This is a challenge to which Europe must rise for three reasons firstly as more scandals and more health risks are uncovered public opinion is now set against the use of pesticides secondly the majority of farmers themselves want the European Union to help them change their practices so that they no longer have to choose between keeping their health and boosting their profitability and thirdly beekeepers all over Europe are calling for strict legislation to stop the sale of pesticides that have not been evaluated for their impact on bees P It is therefore vital that the ambitious stance taken by the Committee on the Environment should be confirmed in tomorrows vote on the three reports by Hiltrud Breyer Christa Klaß and Irena Belohorská We must confirm that health and the environment are foremost that specific measures are needed to protect those most vulnerable to harm that the most dangerous substances will be covered by the precautionary principle that the use of nonchemical alternatives will indeed be encouraged and that aerial spraying will henceforth be banned in principle In short we must translate into practical action the concerns voiced by the very many men and women in Europe who as Mrs IslerBéguin has mentioned have written to us urging that farming should not in future be dependent on chemicals PL Madam President the use of plant protection products pesticides is essential in certain circumstances In Poland there is a preponderance of small agricultural holdings where the owners due to insufficient finance economise on expensive pesticides and this sometimes results in losses as a result of pests P I am in favour of all actions to encourage the rational use of plant protection products including advice training research subsidies for modern plant protection equipment the introduction of substitute products that help to protect the environment and health and that are compatible with farmers interests instead of the use of pesticides P Where there is a risk that the harvest might be lost ignorance and the lack of proper assistance to farmers can lead to the uncontrolled use of pesticides A problem that has been with us for a long time but which has not yet been fully resolved is the issue of the disposal of dumps of highly toxic pesticides that exist or existed in the countries of the former Soviet bloc as well as the recultivation of soil They are poisoning both the water and the soil This baggage could reduce the effectiveness of the measures prepared in these documents PL Madam President producers who are being forced to create food that looks perfect are introducing pesticides that are harmful not just to the environment and to the economy but also to human health I hope that the documents under discussion will lead to an improvement in the quality of food consumed and will encourage more organic production methods with greater use of natural fertilisers to nurture the soil In addition as regards the unscrupulous and unethical practice of exporting substances known to be harmful to third world countries I would quote a popular proverb from Poland Do as you would be done by This is even more important because the dangerous pesticides come back to us in the form of foodstuffs that are purchased cheaply by wealthy countries and destroy peoples health P In addition to the general guidelines strategies for the sustainable use of pesticides should be developed at national level where appropriate action can be taken Reductions in the quantity of plant protection products should be greater in areas where more pesticides are used SK I highly value the fact that all three reports require the personnel involved in all phases of pesticide handling to be highly qualified Action plans integrated management and strict import measures these are also examples of what is positive in all the reports However both the bans on aerial application and alternatively the situations where aerial application would be possible must be articulated precisely using clear wording P Similarly the notion of a quantitative use reduction is not clearly defined and opens the door to many risks because of its nonselective application For example the Slovak Republic applies on average less than 1 kg of pesticides per hectare while other countries apply as much as 8 kg This means that there are countries where pesticide use must be genuinely reduced and countries where pesticide use should even be increased This is why I suggest that when voting we should take into account the recommendations of the European Crop Protection Association or alternatively at first reading not adopt reports and and keep the balanced recommendations of the Commission NL Madam President Commissioners ladies and gentlemen it is time for us to give shape to the thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides and it is also a good idea for us to put some of it into effect immediately In view of the considerable impact on food quality public health the environment and the sustainability of our farming all matters of concern our whole group as well as our rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs have devoted a great deal of time to this package I should like to mention four points in particular P Firstly a further reduction in pesticide use is sensible This must then actually create less of an impact on the environment and for that reason we are against merely reducing the quantity used We want a reduction in the actual impact based on a scientific risk evaluation P Secondly we take a similar view on nonspray zones around watercourses Here again we are in favour of a riskbased approach and we feel that the Member States are better able than we are to make responsible choices based partly on the criteria laid down in the water framework directive P Thirdly I wonder why this Parliament which is after all an advocate of an internal market with a high degree of protection for the consumer health and the environment would oppose a first step towards harmonisation in this area We are in favour of the idea of zones with internal mutual recognition proposed by the Commission and would also like to see voluntary mutual recognition between zones P Finally we are opposed to the general provision of information to neighbours advocated by Mrs Breyer in her report Not only is that information unnecessary for a strictly regulated activity it also causes unnecessary anxiety and frustration Surely the aim cannot be to move towards a sort of private enforcement That is a society we do not want and do not support PL Madam President todays debate is of enormous significance for European agriculture and for environmental protection P There are many people in favour of the use of pesticides and many who are opposed However I believe that the farmers guiding principle should be as few pesticides as possible just those that are essential and the guiding principle of producers and distributors should be the precautionary principle which should be the supreme principle as regards the lives and the health of consumers in every case where the introduction of new pesticides raises concerns either because there is some ambivalence in the results of scientific research or if there has been insufficient time to be able to say categorically that a given product or substance is harmless to humans and animals P In the context of sustainable use of pesticides I believe that the following steps should be taken first of all the Commission as well as Member States should provide periodic training and advisory and educational programmes that are financed at least in part by companies that manufacture pesticides There should be coordinated monitoring and data collection with regard to the harmful effects of pesticides on human health and the environment and this should include longterm research programmes and the imposition of sanctions on polluters A coordinated system should be set up to collect data on the production import export sales distribution and use of pesticides and this should be accessible to the public Agricultural practices that promote the use of low doses of pesticides should be encouraged which will help change the overall usage of these preparations Appropriate checks should be introduced and the import into the EU of agricultural food products produced with the aid of chemicals should be banned NL Madam President plant protection products are still essential for agricultural production and food supplies in Europe The big question when we in Europe take particular measures is what kind of influence this has on competitive relations with the rest of the world If we are too strict in Europe and cannot impose the same rules on the rest of the world that means that we in Europe can consume products that we are unable to produce here which seems wrong to me P Of course it is always essential for us to continue evaluating the harmful effects but we cannot overdo it I agree with everyone who says that we should concentrate on the risk and not on reducing the quantity The 10metre buffer zones will also be disastrous for the Netherlands and others and should be left out of the regulation P Finally information to neighbours If something is approved why should the neighbours also be informed That is completely unnecessary regulation Madam President UK pesticides were tightly controlled in 1985 Firms like Syngenta say that farmers should not be denied the tools they need P These regulations move us away from the principle of good sciencebased regulation For example pavement weed control is 400 times more expensive without chemicals The golf and field sports industry says that without pesticides it is not possible to maintain the turf The Crop Protection Agency says that banning pesticides means between 65 and 200 more land under cultivation reducing productivity Corbett Farms say that this year has shown the value of spraying to prevent potato blight Pesticides are expensive and the lowest amount is used to protect our crop Decisions on how and when to spray must be taken on an individual field basis An arbitrary reduction in use cannot be scientifically based P Madam President please eradicate the EUs pestilent regulations UKIP will vote against DE Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen let me begin by expressing my thanks to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs It goes without saying that all of us care deeply about health and consumer protection and the strength of feeling among the various Members of our House can be gauged from this highly charged debate P It is nevertheless important that we really do decide on the basis of the facts and do not fly in the face of reality by creating scapegoats as it were It would be very easy especially with this legislative package to pick on a particular occupational group and look no further That would be completely wrong It must be established from the outset that all of us in Europe need a functioning agricultural sector which necessarily entails the use of a certain quantity of plant protection agents P On specific aspects of the Klaß report let me say that it is indeed a sound principle to envisage certain reduction targets but I believe the quantitative approach adopted here is simply too rigid Every Member State should truly consider what it can do itself because merely reducing the overall volume and believing this will clean up the environment is downright unscientific As far as the buffer strips are concerned there is nothing wrong with the Commissions chosen strategy of treating subsidiarity as the key element Every Member State should consider how it wants these buffer strips regulated Blindly imposing a Communitywide tenmetre border would be wrong Trying to find nonchemical alternatives in sensitive areas such as habitats of rare flora and fauna is also an approach that should be supported unreservedly P As regards the Breyer report it is important that we support the threezone concept Restricting the scope of licences to single Member States would be an excessively narrow approach Special care is needed with regard to the exclusion criteria An unequivocal ban for CMR1rated substances may be taken as read but in the case of CMR2 substances I am also in favour of taking scientific data as a basis for licensing decisions EL Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the legislative proposal which we will be asked to vote on aims to achieve a high level of protection of human health and the environment by establishing Community models for the sustainable use of pesticides and rules for placing them on the European market P I believe that by supporting the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safetys proposal to reduce pesticide use by 20 in Europe we are sending out a strong message We must strengthen checks on the rational use of pesticides and most importantly promote research into safer alternative methods of plant protection P At the same time the proposal for abolition of the system of zones and mandatory mutual licensing is a balanced position In view of the concerns of farmers and industry it seeks to enable Member States who so wish to implement higher levels of environmental protection in line with their local conditions P Finally let me mention the special need to protect secondary use I call on you ladies and gentlemen to support the proposal to create a European fund for the promotion of research We will thus guarantee the prosperity of farmers and maintain our special national products which are part of European agricultural tradition and significantly boost the European agricultural economy Madam President thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on these three reports P Firstly I believe that we in Europe need to be in a position whereby we can produce European crops and European fruit and vegetables that are safe for human consumption However we need to achieve that objective in a balanced way and in a commonsense way so that we protect human health without penalising agriculture P What we do not want is to put restrictions in place that impact negatively on European agriculture and to end up having to import huge quantities of food with all the implications for food miles and of course with little control over the quantities of pesticides used in the production of that imported food P Secondly I support the proposal for a riskbased assessment which is based on science and will prove workable for Member States P Finally I believe a 10metre buffer zone is a one size fits all solution and needs to be modified to allow Member States to take local conditions into consideration As I said earlier not even the European Parliament can legislate for climatic conditions and soil conditions throughout the entire continent FI Madam President the Thematic Strategy and Framework Directive on plant protection products are challenging legislative projects and are a reflection of the fundamental challenge that EU environmental policy faces which is how to combine the protection of the environment with that of health effectively in a policy which takes account of social realities P We need to recognise that the use of plant protection products and pesticides has major economic benefits The expert use of these substances is to be honest a crucial prerequisite for food production in the modern age At the same time however the adverse impact of plant production products on the environment and on watercourses in particular is a very real one How then can we use these substances in a way which still allows us to benefit from pesticides but which at the same time reduces the adverse effects P I come from a country where farming is a respected occupation and where domestic agriculture is regarded as important On the other hand the environment is particularly fragile For example Finland has almost 200 000 lakes hundreds of thousands of other watercourses and one of the worlds most polluted seas Diffuse water pollution is an immense environmental problem and plant protection products are part of that problem It is a challenging equation and so it is only right that the directive should take the differences between Member States into consideration Obviously we need certain EUwide standards but the remedies applied in Finland cannot be the same as those in Luxembourg say P Therefore reason and environmental concerns dictate that we should concentrate on the targets and leave the means to the Member States themselves A good example of this is the buffer zones which undoubtedly have an important part to play in the protection of watercourses I am confident that buffer zones suited to each situation and consistent with the Commissions proposals are the right way forward If we now decide upon precisely measured limits applying the one size fits all principle there is a real danger that in many countries they will be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire Perhaps I should say rather that they would not be addressing the problem flexibly or satisfactorily DA Madam President there are some misunderstandings in some of the statements from our fellow members here today Therefore I am glad to be able to speak for a second time There are three misunderstandings The first concerns a reduction target some fellow members are saying that this is simply not possible There are differences between the countries and it is not possible to create a common European reduction target No this cannot be done Nor is this what we are doing What we are doing is saying that the common European reduction target should be 20 However this may of course mean 30 in some countries and 10 in others The national reduction target will be established on the basis of national action plans Therefore it is a misunderstanding to fear this item A key element is that we are taking account of the fact that a gram of one pesticide can sometimes be more dangerous than an entire kilogram of another pesticide Therefore we have introduced a treatment frequency index as part of this reduction obligation I can well imagine that the Commission will also have something to say about this when you Mr Dimas are able to speak again in a little while P The second misunderstanding concerns the zones There is a belief that if we do not have the zones it will almost be an insult to the internal market No on the contrary By ending this foolish idea about zones and saying that we will gradually introduce mutual data sharing we are saying that the entire EU is a zone within which we share data However it is clear that we cannot talk about mutual obligatory recognition of pesticides simply because there are different geographical climatic and environmental circumstances in each individual country I think that almost everyone in this House who has spoken today will be in agreement on this point P The third fundamental misunderstanding is that it will destroy the competitiveness of agriculture No In Denmark we have reduced the use of pesticides by 50 since the 1980s without any effect on agricultural competitiveness Pesticides are expensive to use and therefore provided they are used correctly the less they are used the better it is for competitiveness SV Madam President time is short and I am speaking primarily to express my support for the corapporteur of the Breyer report in the PPEDE Group Erna HennicotSchoepges I think it is very unfortunate that the majority of my group chose to ignore Mrs HennicotSchoepges advice on several important points and not to support important proposals contained in the report Of course I agree that the requirement to provide information 48 hours before spraying is impractical and would not work but it is not reasonable to conclude that we do not need any information requirement at all Mrs HennicotSchoepges proposal here as a compromise is wellbalanced P Another important issue is the cutoff criteria for particularly sensitive substances Above all in our decision we must of course be consistent with the decisions taken by Parliament in relation to the new REACH chemicals legislation One of the fundamental principles there was to phase out substances where it is difficult to establish thresholds for risks in the case of highlevel concern substances Obviously we must also follow that line here particularly as we are dealing with substances that come into contact or are liable to come into contact with things we eat P Another issue on which I support the rapporteur Mrs Breyer is the proposal on zoning When I saw the Commissions proposal I immediately found it interesting to try to divide Europe into zones that are relatively similar in terms of vegetation conditions climate and so on However the proposed zoning is unfortunately too arbitrary I cannot support this approach and believe that the Member States must be allowed to retain a right to refuse different preparations even if countries nearby have given them the green light I would like to address other issues but my time is over NL Mr President when I walk out of my village I am in the middle of a unique agricultural area the green heart between big cities like Amsterdam Rotterdam and Utrecht It is still green farming land at the moment but the 10metre buffer zone proposed by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety would make it virtually impossible to farm in the area when it is specifically farming that keeps the area green P Last week I put it to the test but I was hardly able to find any pieces of land between the many ditches that were 20 metres wide Anyone who knows a bit about the Netherlands knows that it is not only in the green heart that this is true It is a characteristic of Dutch farming that there are many ditches between pastureland That means that with 10metre buffer zones the Netherlands would lose 800 000 hectares of its farmland 35 of agricultural area P I am therefore asking Members not to support this proposal also in view of the agricultural production that is necessary in Europe and the world as the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has said That does not actually mean that I do not agree with the aim of protecting nature and public health We all share that ambition I just think it can be better achieved with an approach based on risk analysis and risk reduction P The alternative reducing use certainly sounds nice and simple a 20 reduction overall but it does not provide the best protection for the consumer because it can be looked at only in terms of quantities and not the final effect the final risk In that context I actually find it difficult to understand the painful contortions of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe which is in favour of a 20 overall reduction as well as a risk approach P I have two final points All I will say about the licensing system is that three climate zones are preferable to 27 Member States obviously taking national circumstances into account Finally I would ask the Commission not to overlook minor crops in all these major areas of dispute FR Madam President pesticide residues are now everywhere in food in water in the air in our body tissue and breast milk and most frighteningly of all in the bodies of our unborn children We are only just beginning to glimpse the longterm consequences of this omnipresence of pesticide residues they include various forms of cancer endocrine disorders reduced male fertility damage to our immune systems and degenerative diseases of the nervous system P So yes and yes again let us reduce pesticide use and let us reduce it quickly I fully support the proposals made by my colleague Mrs Hennicot on the Breyer report and in the interests of saving time I will highlight a further point which I consider vital and which has been discussed in the PPE Group namely notification of people living near areas that are to be treated with pesticides I believe that a section of our group is being unreasonable in recommending that no such notification is required on the pretext that if the substances to be applied have prior approval it means they are not harmful P Aerial spraying is commonplace particularly in forests and vineyards It entails a risk of substances being carried into inhabited or sensitive areas so it must be strictly regulated It is essential that growers should issue advance warning of pesticide spraying to people who live close by and are thus potentially exposed People suffering from respiratory conditions such as asthma could be severely affected if they have no advance notice of such spraying Conveying and presenting the information need not imply any additional administrative burden on farmers as some of my fellow Members have suggested Simple notices stating the intended dates of the spraying placed close to human habitation in the areas at risk may be all that is needed P I would like to conclude by urging that it is time to move on to a new generation of agricultural practices that respect the environment and thus play a part in modernising the farming sector PL Madam President the key to the sustainable use of pesticides is rational risk reduction We should achieve this objective by implementing the guidelines in the directive on the sustainable use of pesticides Each country will be obliged to prepare its own plan in accordance with the guidelines given in the directive Each country should be able to do this taking into account local conditions and differences P We differ primarily in the level of agricultural development I repeat the level of agricultural development Those countries that are new members of the European Union often have enormous work to do to catch up as regards the level of development A reduction in the use of pesticides in these countries as compared with the present level of their use will in the final analysis work against us as consumers unless in reducing their use we take into account the present level of use of these products which is relatively low P Our landscape is different too In Poland enormous areas of woodland can be protected against pests only by spraying from the air It is a duty to the natural environment to protect these forests and it is Parliaments responsibility to set out guidelines for the safe use of products that protect the natural environment P The directive speaks a great deal about the farmers level of knowledge being the most important factor for the implementation of sustainable use of pesticides It is the responsibility of us all to support education and to create the conditions so that this information can reach every farmer In tabling an amendment concerning temporary national allowances for pesticides I am speaking in favour of the mechanism for exchanging older preparations for modern and safer ones as quickly as is possible I would ask for your support P The guidelines in the directive should encourage rational measures and they should not discourage Member States and farmers Member of the Commission EL Madam President I thank the speakers in tonights sitting for their positive remarks Permit me to set out briefly the Commissions views on certain important issues that have been raised P Let me begin with the thematic strategy and in particular with the points not covered by the directive P First of all I am pleased that the report supports the thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides The proposal to bring in new legislation to deal with the risky of pesticide use is particularly good P I agree with how important more research is into the impact of the combined and cumulative use of pesticides on health In my opinion the principle of substitution is vital it removes the most hazardous substances from the market and replaces them with safer alternative solutions some of which are nonchemical P Finally the Belohorská report adopted by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety puts forward certain additional measures which are especially positive P Let me now turn specifically to the framework directive Many of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament make useful clarifications and can be accepted Other amendments however are liable to bring about undesired results I should like first of all to comment on the basic amendments which the Commission can fully accept in principle or in part P The Commission partially accepts the proposal that Member States set up individual targets in their own national action plans for the restriction of the use of the most hazardous pesticides Indeed setting up such targets is consistent with the directives general aim to reduce the risk of using pesticides Laying down an overall permanent target for the reduction of pesticide use at EU level however in addition to national targets is not necessary and is therefore not endorsed by the Commission In fact the overall reduction of the quantity of pesticides does not necessarily entail a corresponding reduction in risk the level of risk varies from one substance to another Thus action to limit risk must focus in the main on the most harmful substances P The Commission can in principle accept the laying down of a minimum width for the buffer zones to be created in fields located next to water courses because this will bring additional environmental gains Imposing a limit of 10 metres however indiscriminately and in all cases does not seem appropriate The Commission would prefer Member States to have a margin of flexibility and set the appropriate width for buffer zones in line with their own geographical features P The Commission can also accept certain useful clarifications on other issues such as technical training and certification There are however amendments which the Commission cannot endorse P Firstly the Commission is convinced that mandatory adherence to common general rules on integrated pest management by professional pesticide users is a fundamental measure to reduce dependence on pesticides It is of important environmental benefit throughout the EU and will contribute to the development of a sustainable and competitive agriculture sector I cannot therefore accept the elimination under Amendment 86 of this exceptionally important measure contained in the European Commissions proposal P Secondly the European Commission agrees to take measures to protect populations living close to fields where aerial spraying is carried out Nevertheless it considers that a complete ban on the use of pesticides in socalled sensitive areas is disproportionate We must leave some discretion to Member States and local authorities If this it ever necessary and in exceptional rare cases when only the use of pesticides are effective they must be allowed to deal with risks to human health or biodiversity P Thirdly although the Commission has committed itself to looking into extending the directives scope of application to biocides such a decision requires careful study as well as the implementation of certain aspects of the directive on pesticides When more data is made available to us through the revision programme envisaged in the directive on biocides we will be able better to deal with the use of biocides P Fourthly the Commission cannot support the addition of a reference to Article 1524 of the Treaty since the proposed directive is clearly focused on environmental protection which already includes public health issues P Fifthly although the imposition of taxes and contributions complies with the polluter pays principle there is no effective system at the moment for differentiating tax rates according to the risk posed by each pesticide For this reason the Commission prefers that taxes and contributions should be imposed at Community level not at the present stage but until such a time as a study has been carried out into the issue P Madam President the Commission can accept 121 amendments of the 166 that were tabled of these it can accept 25 fully and 96 in principle or in part I am lodging with Parliaments secretariat a full list of the Commissions positions on the amendments P Let me once again to thank all those who have contributed to this evenings debate and in particular the rapporteurs for their work Thank you for your attention Member of the Commission EL Madam President let me begin by reminding Members of the EUs current fundamental policy to promote and support healthy eating Fruit and vegetables are certainly a very important in a healthy diet It is very important to take this on board We have thus two aims today We need to guarantee fruit and vegetable production and this is a golden opportunity for production and to support of agriculture Secondly we must ensure that fruit and vegetables are safe for consumption We believe that the Commissions proposal succeeds in tackling this dual challenge in a balanced fashion P I have followed the debate by all the MEPs with considerable interest The arguments put forward are serious and we will take them properly into account Owing to the pressure of time I do not want to enlarge on all the issues Let me just touch on two or three which I believe are very important and have been raised today P Firstly on the subject of protecting vulnerable groups I agree that we need to protect them and this has been taken into account in the proposed regulation We are also willing to accept the amendment to the included definition of vulnerable groups simply because it guarantees their even greater protection One comment I should like to make although not directly connected with the subject under discussion is on imported products I stress that they are also monitored for pesticide residues thanks to another regulation on the maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues We have inspection rules guaranteeing consumer protection for imports too P More generally approval criteria are a very important part of the legislation Indeed the proposals main aim is to protect the health of citizens and the environment This is of great importance and we should not forget it The proposed approval criteria are necessary to achieve this aim so the Commission cannot accept any deviation from them It is obvious from the debate and from some of the amendments that the European Parliament also shares these aims Certain amendments would even strengthen these criteria The Commission is of the view that the proposed criteria ought to ensure a high level of protection without making plant protection unworkable or dysfunctional Consequently the Commission will not be able to accept amendments which could undermine these criteria P I come finally to the controversial subject of mutual recognition which is brought about by dovetailing the different zones in this sector I believe that our proposal has been somewhat misconstrued First of all let me remind you that the new proposal will introduce stricter criteria to be implemented on a zonal basis We should bear this in mind for it will ensure higher levels of protection for health and the environment let us at the same time strive towards a single market internal market thus avoiding the anomaly of a single market for agricultural products on the one hand and a divided market for plant protection products on the other If we bear in mind particular features relating to climate and soil division into separate zones is inevitable The issue is not however so simple and clear cut hence I have predicted a possible misunderstanding Whereas Member States might act to protect themselves and on the other hand during the decisionmaking procedure which needs the approval of the first Member State of the zone experts from other Member States will be able to play an active part in the licensing procedure and by doing so will be able to assess the circumstances for the entire zone In other words the decision will not be taken in isolation and unilaterally by a Member State belonging to the zone but representatives of the other Member States in that zone will participate through this procedure They will be able to present their views and to persuade others of the particular conditions prevailing in their countries P Let me single out water protection This is also a sensitive point which has been raised by a number of MEPs The proposal accounts for the need to protect water resources and especially the Framework Directive on Water Policy If it is clear from the risk assessment that under the proposed terms of use the permissible limits be exceeded in vulnerable areas the Member State involved can and must reject the use of pesticides in that particular area Furthermore if the Member State can prove that all its soil is a vulnerable area it has the option not to approve the product in question at all Therefore the special features and the need to protect water resources are taken clearly into account in the new regulations proposed procedure For this reason the Commission while appreciating the comments made would not be able to accept amendments relating to the system of approval on a zonal basis P As I have said there are over 250 amendments and there is no time to analyse them in detail I see that we still have a difference of opinions but I anticipate that the procedure and debate will enable us to find common ground P Klass

are released deliberately into the environment and onto food Only about 1 of a pesticide actually reaches its target Therefore when we prepare legislation on the use and on the permitting of pesticides we have to keep in mind what is in the interests of the different stakeholders It is in the interests of farmers to have a high harvest and good quality products with low costs If they can attain this goal with less pesticide they can save on costs and provide healthier products It is in the interests of citizens to have safe cheap products and pesticidefree drinking water Therefore using less and safer pesticides is in the interests of almost everyone P If we want to achieve tangible pesticide use reduction in Europe we need effective national plans for reduction focusing on the local circumstances and using local opportunities in writing P I support the thrust of this report as it enhances the current legislation governing plant protection products in a way that should give consumers more confidence about the foods that they eat it should give those in direct contact with these products such as producers farmers suppliers with clearer guidelines in relation to the use of pesticides and in general it will provide for the safe production of agricultural products in the EU P However it is important to point out that increasing legislation in this area will only be effective if there are sufficient checks and monitoring in Member States Currently it would appear that while there is some monitoring for residues on food products it may not be adequate to provide sufficient assurances to consumers of these products Steps need to be taken to ensure that the measures foreseen under this legislation are enforced through effective monitoring in writing HU Madam President ladies and gentlemen we have now been debating the details of this legislative package on plant protection products for a good many months In this time we have examined numerous viewpoints and incorporated them into the text As a result of this process I think the draft we now have before us is one that is based on compromise in many respects and that meets as many demands as it possibly could There are some issues however that should not be subject to compromise When peoples health is at stake economic interests cannot be allowed to take precedence This piece of legislation is not about the competitiveness of Europes agricultural sector but about protecting the health of European citizens We have also seen that current rules in individual Member States differ widely In my country they are among the strictest While here in Strasbourg we have been debating whether a buffer zone of 5 or 10 metres should be established beside watercourses Hungary has had buffer zones of 50 metres and in some places even 500 metres in place for decades Moreover although use of plant protection products by our farmers is 15 times lower than in the Netherlands Europes intervention stores when they still existed were bursting at the seams with Hungarian maize In view of all these things I ask my fellow Members to use their vote tomorrow to support the introduction of strict cutoff criteria On the basis of the compromise draft text this would apply to a mere 29 substances out of more than 600 This is not too high a price to pay for ensuring that proven carcinogenic and toxic compounds stay off the menu Even if there are differences as a result of specific national situations when it comes to voting we are agreed in this regard Let us use our vote then to enable us to sit down to eat with a good conscience in writing SK Just like we have medicines for people we also have medicines for plants pesticides can justifiably be called that since they are medicines in the fight against diseases pests and weeds Of course they must be used in accordance with set rules Incorrect application results in organism failures that manifest themselves as cancer P Ladies and gentlemen our approach to this issue must be based on scientific analysis We must not succumb to pesticide hysteria unleashed in the European Parliament Food selfsufficiency in Europe is falling and this is increasing the dependence of the agrifood industry on world market supplies We must remember that a shortage of foodstuffs would lead to an increase in their prices P Following a consultation with experts I consider some amendments of EU Directive 91414EEC and the Framework Directive on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides tabled by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety to be unworkable These new components stray from the principle of focused and proportionate legislation based on a scientific approach P I realise that we need harmonised European pesticide legislation to ensure that foodstuffs are safe That said we must not prevent farmers from using the tools they need to produce safe nutritious and accessible food P I cannot support the reports by Mrs Christa Klaß and Mrs Hiltrud Breyer as adopted by the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety I will vote for them only if the amendments by my political group the PPEDE are adopted",

    "input": "Agenda Ladies and gentlemen with the agreement of the political groups and in accordance with our Rules of Procedure I propose the following amendments to the agenda for the current partsession P Firstly I propose that the vote on the motions for resolutions tabled to close the debate on the EURussia Summit be moved to the next partsession in Brussels on behalf of the ALDE Group Mr President I rise on a point of order under Rule 166 and with reference to Rules 45 77 89 113 and 155 We took a decision yesterday that we would have a resolution on the EURussia Summit this week and my Group believes that we should stick to that I know there is an attempt to try to revote that decision but I hope the House will sensibly see off such a narrowminded approach to politics P Applause Are there any other comments on behalf of the PSE Group DE Mr President this now also concerns fellow Members We were not informed about this application There was a communication problem here yesterday Neither the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats nor my group were informed of this request This is also the reason why we have been feeling relatively overlooked and have abstained from voting We have both that is my fellow Member Mr Daul and I put forward the proposal this morning that we flesh out this resolution with care We note the desire for a resolution and accept it on condition that we flesh it out with care After the summit we shall also have all the information available hence the deferral of the proposal until after the summit on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President I do not know how strong communications are within the large groups We have always said that we want a resolution the General Secretaries have been informed of this We have said that if you speak out against this we shall do so at the vote on Monday morning as is our right We have always said so and if this has not been relayed to you it is not our problem but yours P As regards the content a new law against extremists for example has been adopted in Russia in recent weeks that clearly restricts freedom of the press and freedom of opinion We therefore want the resolution to be adopted before the summit to enable the EU to state our position on the situation in Russia through this resolution We shall still be able to draw up a resolution on the results after the summit but this Parliament which wants to be political should also adopt political freedom of expression by a majority before the summit in order to show mainland Russia what we think about freedom and democracy here in the European Parliament P Applause DE Mr President we would all certainly go along with this Mr CohnBendit has stated precisely what we are all thinking However in this House there are rules of procedure not just because we want to torment people but because large groups with way over 200 members also have problems which you have perhaps to a lesser extent Mr CohnBendit in your smaller group namely that we have to be able to consult one another When I add the members of the Group of the European Peoples Party Christian Democrats and European Democrats and those of my group together there are way over 450 Members in this House who need a little time for consultation P I would therefore make the following proposal what Mr CohnBendit has said here that we convey to the Russian side that we consider this law unfair and that it should be retracted the Commission and the Council can pick up from here on This is certainly a statement of the will of the entire European Parliament which has already been made clear through this discussion P A resolution however that contains 6070 items also has to be able to be discussed a little and only by doing so will it work We therefore ask for the debate the draft resolution and then the vote at the next sitting This is in actual fact a fair compromise Please endorse it Ladies and gentlemen according to our Rules of Procedure the point that Mr Watson has raised is correct and is well established in the Rules of Procedure It is evident however that there is a difference of opinion on this issue P In accordance with the Rules of Procedure we are going to resolve this issue in the only way that we can which is on the basis that Parliament is sovereign We are therefore going to have two votes the first vote will be to vote on whether you want to vote on this matter If the result of this vote is negative we will leave the agenda as it is and there will be no amendments If you decide that you do want to vote we will then vote on the item as to whether or not the vote on the motions for resolutions will be postponed P I therefore put to the vote the question of whether Parliament wishes to vote on this matter P Parliament decided to vote on the matter P Consequently I now put to the vote the proposal that I presented to you that is to move the vote on the motions for resolutions on the EURussia Summit to the next partsession in Brussels Those who vote in favour will be voting in favour of moving this vote to the next partsession and those who vote against will be voting in favour of keeping the agenda as it is P Parliament approved the proposal P Secondly I propose that the following two reports currently entered with debate on Thursday between 3 pm and 4 pm be entered directly in the votes on Thursday at 12 noon P the report by Margie Sudre on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the amended proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Madagascar C600642007 and P the report by Emanuel Jardim Fernandes on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mozambique C602842007 P If there are no comments we shall include these votes directly on Thursday in the voting time at 12 noon Mr President I rise on a point of order on the same legal basis as Mr Watson I merely wish to point out that we have had a very important debate about the increase of democracy within the EU This tactic which has apparently just been successful demonstrates that democracy even within this Parliament needs to be extended further I can say as a member of a large group the PPEDE Group of which I am extremely proud to be a member that the blame for not holding a resolution was put on other groups I then found out that this was an agreement by the two large groups Quite clearly this is an unsatisfactory way to proceed P I accept the decision My practical recommendation to you Mr President would be to ensure that the full verbatim account of the debate on the EURussia Summit be presented by the PresidentinOffice of the Council and the President of the Commission to President Putin at the summit not afterwards P Applause FR Mr President regarding the entry of the reports on fishing I do not know if it was an interpreting error but you said that it would be with debate and was on the agenda for Thursday morning It will be without debate So I think it was an interpreting error Ladies and gentlemen we propose that they be entered directly in the voting time on Thursday at 12 noon They are currently entered with debate on Thursday between 3 pm and 4 pm We therefore propose that they be entered in the votes on Thursday at 12 noon without debate P Parliament approved the proposal",

resolution P Before the vote on behalf of the PPEDE Group FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen I refer to Rules 19 and 166 of the Rules of Procedure Before Parliament votes on the joint motion for a resolution by certain groups on freedom of movement I would like to condemn most firmly on behalf of my group the personal attack in paragraph 13 thereof on the VicePresident of the Commission Franco Frattini P I wish to denounce a politically undignified manoeuvre by the Italian Socialists taken up by certain of my fellow Members which is unworthy of the challenges we face More serious still this untruthful distortion of Mr Frattinis comments which our institution must reject will mean we cannot make a composed decision P If our group were to vote against this resolution because of this manoeuvre this would not in any way diminish our support for all the Romanian and other EU nationals who obey the law and respect their host country P Europe is founded on the rule of law something we reaffirm in the resolution my group has signed on the joint initiative of our Italian and Romanian colleagues The question of freedom of movement is not just a national matter but a European one It is not a case of settling political scores but a question of values ladies and gentlemen P Applause on behalf of the PSE Group DE Mr President we held an extensive debate in this Chamber in which Commissioner Frattini took part The Commissioner responded very moderately in his own comments and in his answers to speeches from various Members The resolution criticises only one point that is that it can be proved that Commissioner Frattini gave the public incorrect information on a specific point of European law P The fact that our resolution corrects this and also clarifies that the Commissioner responsible for the legal protection of the citizens of Europe made an incorrect statement in public on an essential question of citizens rights is the duty of this Parliament and has nothing to do with any conspiracy theories However we know very well Mr Daul that you are a pitiful Member because you were pressured by Forza Italia to make that statement That is all there is to be said on the matter P Applause from the left We do not want to conduct a debate here now on behalf of the VertsALE Group IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I think that we should comment on the statement by the chairman Mr Daul separately This Parliament will express itself with a majority and has every right to criticise or censure the Commissioners It is the sovereign right of this Parliament P If we did what we did it was because Mr Frattini misinterpreted Community law and although it is difficult to make myself heard above all this shouting I would like to repeat that we are acting here as MEPs towards a European Commissioner and we will continue to do so P Applause from the left Please could we be a little less emotional in dealing with this matter on behalf of the ALDE Group Mr President I wish to speak briefly on a point of order Independently of any party political debate it is highly unwise of Commissioners to get involved in party political matters in their own countries or in anybody elses country I think it is not unreasonable that this House should remind the Commission of its duties in this regard P Applause from the left I now have three more speeches and then we shall close this short debate on behalf of the GUENGL Group FR Mr President I think I do not need to add much to what Monica Frassoni Graham Watson and Martin Schulz have said I would simply like to say this it would be sensible when any Commissioner has his words challenged by four groups who are not all from the same half of the Chamber for him to reflect on what he should avoid doing again if he wants to have Parliaments trust P Applause IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen in accordance with Rules 151 and 19 of the Rules of Procedure I ask you to assess the admissibility of paragraph 13 which contains an unmotivated and unfounded personal attack on the VicePresident of the Commission This is a text which if approved after the statements by the spokesperson of the Commission President defending Mr Frattini would cause an unseemly conflict between Parliament and the Commission for internal political reasons Therefore I ask you to put the text of the motion to the vote without paragraph 13 and at the same time I ask the authors to retract the text via an oral amendment P Before the vote on paragraph 1 IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to add the following oral amendment Expresses its deep regret at the murder of Ms Giovanna Reggiani in Rome on 31 October 2007 and sends its sincere condolences to her family P The oral amendment was accepted P Before the vote on paragraph 13 on behalf of the UEN Group IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to add the following amendment Considers education and the fight against school dropout within Roma communities to be one of the fundamental tools for combating social exclusion exploitation and crime P The oral amendment was not accepted P Before the vote on Recital F IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen considering the importance of the conditions set forth in Articles 5 6 7 and 8 of Directive 200438EC on the right of entry and residence P The oral amendment was not

    "input": "Appointment of 7 members of the Court of Auditors debate The next item is the joint debate of seven reports from Mrs Ayala Sender of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the proposed nomination of David Bostock Michel Cretin Maarten B Engwirda Henri Grethen Harald Noack Ioannis Sarmas and Hubert Weber as Members of the Court of Auditors rapporteur ES Mr President as you all know the members of the Court of Auditors are nominated by the Council for a sixyear mandate following consultation with Parliament It is the Committee on Budgetary Control which is responsible for preparing the opinion of the Parliament P The Court is currently composed of 27 members from the Member States of the Union and we are now preparing to renew the mandate of four candidates David Bostock for the United Kingdom Maarten B Engwirda for the Netherlands Ioannis Sarmas for Greece and Hubert Weber for Austria and to propose three new members Michel Cretin for France Henri Grethen for Luxembourg and Harald Noack for Germany P During the procedure in the Committee on Budgetary Control all candidates were approved but not all of them unanimously However we shall see that subject to a few clarifications in principle my final proposal is that if there are no further comments all these nominations should be approved P Following the personal interviews of the three new candidates I would like to emphasise the good showing made by Mr Cretin the French candidate who will bring to the Court his considerable experience in international auditing both in connection with the UN and NATO The Committee on Budgetary Control considered this experience to be a huge plus P During the personal interviews of the four Members whose mandate is up for renewal the most important topic was their opinion on the selfassessment process embarked upon by the Court of Auditors which is due to terminate at the end of 2008 as well as the contribution of each candidate to the current debate about the need to reform the way in which the Court is organised especially since enlargement given that it currently has a Board of 27 members and also with a view to enhancing its effectiveness and modernisation P In this context I would like to say that Mr Sarmas was particularly impressive and he was supported unanimously by the Committee I imagine because he was particularly cooperative during the approval process P On the other hand the understanding reached between Mr Engwirda and the Government of the Netherlands was not entirely transparent and this aroused some suspicions in the Committee P As for Mr Weber currently President of the Court of Auditors I would like to clear up one point before the vote which is of particular concern to me and which arose after the confirmation hearing in the Committee on Budgetary Control and so I think that this forum offers an excellent opportunity to clarify it P Mr President with this in mind I would like to ask you to allow Mr Weber to speak when I have finished in order to clarify the following matter P On 13 November 2007 following the presentation of the Annual Report of the Court of which Mr Weber is President various statements were made on BBC News by a former Commission chief accountant claiming that 80 of the Community budget was still suspect Immediately following this was a quote from Mr Weber saying that that analysis constituted the more orthodox approach but that the quite different statement by Mr Kallas was also valid P I would like to hear the truth and for Mr Weber to confirm whether these statements are his and if not I would like him to publish a denial and to send a copy to this House so as to prevent the damage caused to public opinion by this type of contradiction amongst the general public P Returning to the content of my report I would like to register my frustration at the fact that the Council whose absence at this sitting I repeat is regrettable has once again ignored the criteria laid down by Parliament in its resolution of 1992 with a view to achieving greater transparency P Basically the Council has ignored in two cases the recommendation not to exceed two mandates in other words 12 years service at the Court of Auditors Worse however is its disregard of the recommendation of this Parliament about the need to strike a better balance at the Court between men and women Whereas to date there are 5 women out of a total of 27 Members it is now proposed that they be reduced to four In this connection I feel once and for all that the Council should adopt special measures P In this connection too we demand that the Council recognise that good relations between Parliament and the Court of Auditors are essential if the control system is to function properly We should therefore receive the Council proposal with its proposed nominations in due time and be able to cooperate more closely with Members in the period prior to the decision P Even more importantly we would remind the Council of the need to respect the opinion of the European Parliament in order to avoid a repetition of what happened in 2004 following a negative opinion in respect of one of its proposed Members which was totally ignored by the Council P With the future of the Court in mind I would like to mention the concern widely felt among Members of the European Parliament about the efficacy of such an important body when it is governed by a Board of up to 27 members We therefore await with some impatience the conclusion of the Courts selfassessment exercise and in fact in my report I recommend that the Parliament should study it carefully at the end of 2008 when it is submitted and that it should take up a position on the various options P Meanwhile however improvements can be made and so I invite the Court of Auditors to use all means at its disposal to rationalise and simplify its work in particular by using the options available under the current Treaty for example the possibility of adopting reports by a majority and not always by consensus and also the possibility of establishing panels responsible for specific reports which do not therefore have to be processed by the entire Board P Accordingly I recommend that in adopting the proposal to approve the nominations of Members with the provisos mentioned the Parliament should express the wish that at any rate we should receive clarification on what I proposed previously Thank you Mrs Ayala As Mr Weber is not in the room I hope that your appeal will be relayed to him by one of his colleagues so that Mr Weber can answer your concerns on behalf of the PPEDE Group BG Today we are going to vote the nominations for seven new members of the Court of Auditors The European Parliament and the MEPs have always attached great importance to this institution Being a MEP from Bulgaria and a representative of a new Member State I find the proper functioning of the Court of Auditors and its effective cooperation with the MEPs to be of great importance for the financial health of the whole European Union P In the course of the hearings of the nominees at the Budgetary Control Committee we had the opportunity to see their professional competences their personal knowledge and their individual motivation Of course we could only regret the fact that there was no woman or young person among the nominees but the European Parliament has no powers over the Member States and the selection they make at the national level P Our responsibility as MEPs is to assess the nominations and I believe that those we have heard at the Budgetary Control Committee are worthy of being elected to the Court of Auditors The majority which the seven nominations carried during the Committee voting is a testimony to the high appreciation we gave to each of these nominees Their political and professional independence was among the fundamental criteria that guided our assessment of the nominations The Group of EPPED in the European Parliament will support all nominations in its expectations for good and fruitful cooperation with the members of the European Court of Auditors DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen I welcome the proposals for the appointment of seven members of the Court of Auditors and can only reiterate how important the work of the Court of Auditors is in protecting the financial interests of the EU and the Member States The Court of Auditors plays a key role in the pursuit of this aim and has established an excellent reputation It performs its task fearlessly fairly professionally and independently but of course it always has to rely on individuals for it is people who make any institution tick And since its members are proposed by the Member States it is actually to the latter that my remarks are primarily addressed P On considering these nominees some might object to their relatively high ages For these particular positions however I regard personal and professional experience as crucial factors and auditors simply do not possess these attributes in sufficient measure at the age of 25 30 or 35 The more warranted criticism in my view relates to the percentage of women which is very low The quality of candidates however must also take precedence over their sex I attach great importance to the development of team spirit and esprit de corps and to the quest for close ties with national audit offices There should be cooperation but not dependence P As you know the question whether the Court of Auditors has too many members has been hotly debated in recent times The decision has now been taken by virtue of the Reform Treaty There remains some concern and it is a legitimate concern as to whether a Court with 27 members can still operate at maximum efficiency The number and the profile of the members must be right Above all particularly in this domain professional competence must not be subordinated to political considerations Thinking ahead to future restructuring plans which there will surely be I would like to cite the example of the Federal Audit Office in the country I come from which has a large number of members I believe there are more than 50 but in which each member heads a department and is fully involved in audit operations as well as enjoying full judicial independence P Whatever the future holds for the Federal Audit Office it is and will remain our main ally in the task of budgetary scrutiny I think we should ask whether Mr Weber would like to say a few words to comment on or react to the appeal made by the rapporteur for this debate Mrs Ayala P Mr Weber would you like to say a few words President of the Court of Auditors DE Mr President I had already left the chamber when this question was asked Needless to say I should like to clarify the matter It was alleged that in a BBC interview I had sided with Mrs Andreasen I can tell you that I certainly did give an interview to the BBC but the name Andreasen was not even mentioned in it Two of my staff who are here can testify to that P Another particularly important point is that I am supposed to have said that 80 of expenditure had got the red light if I may express it in these simple terms I actually said the exact opposite The interviewer who is free of course in the way he chooses to present things asked me whether I had a problem with Mr Kallass statement to the effect that 40 of expenditure had been given the green light I replied that I had no problem with it I say this to make it clear that there is no difference between Mr Kallass perception and my own One can always argue about percentages This one might even be higher than 40 but I must reaffirm that the figure 80 did not pass my lips I did not make any reference to Mrs Andreasen because the issue is between the Commission and Mrs Andreasen and the Court has no wish to interfere in that Thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to respond Thank you for your clarification which answers the rapporteurs concerns The joint debate is now closed P The vote will take place this morning at 11 am",

country Malta which together with Cyprus joined the Euro area two weeks ago bringing the number of countries using the Euro as their currency to 15 This means that the majority of EU Member States now use the same currency During the celebrations held in Malta two days ago the Presidents of the Council and the Commission and also Mario Mauro VicePresident of the European Parliament all congratulated Malta on the rapid progress it had made in the three years since it joined the European Union and on its transition to the Euro which is going well and without any problems In fact despite the fact that the dual circulation period runs until the end of this month I can state that after just two weeks almost all transactions are already being carried out in euros The people of Malta and Gozo are proud to embrace the Euro and to have made another great step forward in the process of European union FR Mr President in December the European Court of Justice handed down a longawaited judgment that has very worrying implications for the protection of posted workers in Europe P It sends a negative signal to our citizens who are concerned about the risks of social dumping What does the Court say in this socalled Laval ruling It says that the Swedish trade unions were wrong to try to force a Latvian undertaking to sign their collective agreement in particular with regard to the minimum wage Under the 1996 Directive however posted workers have to observe a nucleus of mandatory rules for minimum protection in the host Member State P The Court rules that the Swedish system of collective bargaining was not applicable and that such rules could only be imposed by the law The European message is thus no longer clear on the one hand the Commission prioritises flexicurity and the system of collective bargaining as a model on the other hand the Court of Justice discredits this model P Parliament and the Council must therefore clarify this issue Otherwise it would be like throwing the Bolkestein Directive out the front door only to allow it to sneak in the back which would be entirely unacceptable Mr President I rise on a matter which refers particularly to one Member State but I believe has wider European implications This year is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue One institution which does much to promote intercultural dialogue is the British Council It is therefore of particular concern that Russia seeks to close the offices of the British Council in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg The work of the British Council in Russia is perfectly legal It is regulated by a 1994 cultural agreement between London and Moscow I therefore request that the matter be raised by colleagues with Russia in the context of our interparliamentary dialogue and that you Mr President use any opportunity which presents itself to express concern to the Russian authorities that a cultural matter regulated by a perfectly normal agreement between two countries is being trodden upon in an attempt by the Russian authorities to stifle political debate PL Mr President the House has debated the problems associated with the demographic shortfall threatening Europe on many occasions that is to say we have discussed the consequent social problems At the same time VAT on childrens goods in the European Union is charged at the basic rate in other words at the highest possible rate P Childrens goods were subject to a special lower rate in Poland before my country joined the Union One of the legal implications of Polands entry into the Union unfortunately involved raising the VAT rate on childrens goods which ran counter to the familyorientated policy adopted by Poland P I call on the European Commission to consider amending the relevant provisions for the benefit of all Member States of the Union and in particular for the benefit of the poorest families bringing up children This would help us all to implement the Lisbon Strategy ES Mr President the Commissions Work Programme for 2008 states that the citizen is and should be the core of the European project P Extrapolating on this idea I believe that the European Union is not approaching the Kosovo process in the correct manner We cannot continue to debate whether this or that international situation is appropriate for recognising Kosovos independence One question must take precedence over all the others what do the people of Kosovo want They are the most important of all The key to resolving the conflicts lies in two elements respect for human rights and recognition of their right as a people to decide freely on their future P I believe that the European Union should use these words as a reference for situations that arise both within and outside its borders CS I would like to talk about an awkward issue which is the widespread campaign against smoking and smokers in the European Union a campaign which is also based on legal acts passed by the European Parliament There is no doubt that the motivation for the campaign is a noble one as it relates to citizens health However in my opinion it is also highlighting issues which are not dignified and which discriminate against a large section of society which has practically been criminalised due to its dependence on smoking The heavy financial losses of pubtype establishments in the countries that introduced a ban on smoking in restaurants cannot be overlooked either I presume that the attention that is given to smokers should also appropriately be given to the tobacco industry It is not a secret that for decades some ingredients have been added to tobacco such as nitrosamines which are nitrogen compounds that cause cancer and an increased absorption of nicotine In most cases the damage to a human being is caused not by nicotine but by these very admixtures In my opinion tobacco production and the composition of tobacco products should also be subject to regulation Mr President three years ago this month Robert McCartney was brutally murdered by IRA members in Belfast Abhorrence at that murder reached this House when the McCartney sisters brought here and put their case for justice in respect of that P Three years on justice still evades them Why Primarily because the party which could help the most Sinn Fein is still more interested in protecting their own than seeing the killers brought to justice Indeed the situation has worsened because pressure on Sinn Fein has been eased by their admission to government with the result that for the sake of maintaining that government those like my former party the DUP are prepared to let Sinn Fein off the hook P Tragically justice for Robert McCartney is secondary to maintaining the chuckle coalition at Stormont Likewise with the more recent murder of Paul Quinn undoubtedly by the military wing of Sinn Fein it too will be shamefully whitewashed and swept under the carpet That is what happens when you treat with the forces of terrorism EL Mr President in our first partsession of the New Year I would like to talk about the political crisis which continues to beset Lebanon be mired and the role that our Parliament should play P Together with the complex economic and political problems faced by this friendly nation there is still an institutional vacuum because since 23 November 2007 it has not been possible for its parliament to elect a president this election has been postponed 12 times Thus parliament remains closed and there is no possibility of discussing problems and prospects or of putting to good use all the parliaments constitutional powers to elect a president P I am aware of your sensitivity and the messages that you have sent to try to achieve this aim Mr President but I want to stress once again that we must express our deep unease concerning the consequences of this crisis for the suffering people of Lebanon as well as for peace and stability in the region Our democratic duties oblige us to do this as do our obligations within the partnership The association agreement with Lebanon provides for a stable political dialogue between the European Parliament and the Lebanese Parliament we must make good use of this opportunity and send an effective message FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen Slovenia the only country of the former Yugoslavia to have joined the European Union has now taken over the Presidency of the Union On the occasion of this historic event we would like to wish it every success with its Presidency P Nonetheless there has never been a more pressing need to resolve the Yugoslavian crisis once and for all be it the Kosovo issue or speeding up the accession of its Balkan neighbours The only solution for the countries that were part of the former Yugoslavia is swift accession to the Union in accordance with the established criteria Peace requires an ambitious vision and in particular the will to move beyond the Balkans history and look towards a European future P To date the Kosovo issue has not been resolved because the international community has been unable to come to an agreement The European Union has also been a victim of this deadlock this syndrome Between the countries that are fearful of the effects of independence and those who dream only of validating their independence as soon as possible for various diplomatic reasons Slovenia will initially have to ensure the cohesion of the Union by seeking first and foremost an internal compromise if the EUs foreign policy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon is not to be trivialised or even ridiculed P We know nevertheless that Mount Triglav in Slovenia symbolises determination and accomplishment Let us hope therefore that it will be the symbol of 2008 SL Croatia announced an environmental fishing zone in the Adriatic in October 2003 Slovenia and Italy objected to it This led a year later to the signing of an agreement between Slovenia Italy the European Union and Croatia According to that agreement the zone does not affect the Member States In spite of that the Croatian Assembly decided unilaterally last year that the environmentalfishing zone would affect the Member States as well from 1 January of this year at the latest P The Assembly thereby made the lives of people living around the Adriatic difficult This unilateral decision by Croatia presented problems for fishermen for example because it reduced their fishing territory and the port of Koper lost its access to international waters The Assemblys decision that the environmentalfishing zone should affect the Member States from 1 January of this year is contrary to the international obligation accepted by Croatia and gives reason to doubt its credibility Obligations adopted by a country should not be violated in modern democratic legal states It totally contradicts the political culture of the European Union P I therefore wonder if Croatia truly wishes to become a member of the European Union If it does it must act immediately and start complying with the agreement on the environmentalfishing zone as well as with all other agreements reached thus far HU The Szigetköz lying partly in Austria and Slovakia and the Hungarian stretch of the Danube is one of the most beautiful areas in Europe It is an island of biodiversity with its natural features the wealth of its fauna and flora its water habitats and the traditional way of life of the people who live there P Unfortunately the flow rate of the river nourishing this region has dropped to danger level over the past decades due to hydrological interference It is not just in the interests of the area affected but in the interests of Hungary and the entire Union that this unique natural asset is not lost to future generations P We already have good laws such as the Water Framework Directive which should in principle protect the region However for these to be successful they need to be enforced at national and Union level It would be desirable for Slovakia regardless of the NagyDuna matter to cooperate with Hungary in stabilising the water supply to this area P I would like to invite you on a tour in this romantic landscape in the Spring but unfortunately we cannot do it without water and so we need every possible assistance FR Mr President I would like to draw the attention of this House to the fate of two French journalists Pierre Creisson and Thomas Dandois who are currently in prison in Niger They are accused of undermining state security which carries a possible death sentence in Niger P There is no doubt that the two journalists and their driver AlHassane broke Niger laws by entering a prohibited area In my opinion however it was for sound journalistic reasons because their aim was to report on the Tuareg rebellion and they also intended to return to the capital to question the Niger authorities so that they would have as broad a view as possible P I therefore believe that it is essential for us to take action to help these two journalists firstly because they risk being sentenced to death a punishment that is out of all proportion with their actions and secondly because Niger is considered to be a friend of ours and a country that we help a great deal It would not deserve the reputation that this attitude could generate P I believe Mr President that you and my fellow Members could be of great assistance if you participate in this request for reflection for clemency from President Tandja so that these two journalists can be released Even though they did break Niger laws their actions do not warrant such a long imprisonment We shall monitor all this very carefully PL Mr President I take the floor today as a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties Justice and Home Affairs and also as a citizen of a country that has been forced to fight for its independence and freedom on many occasions P I should like to draw the attention of the House to the lack of respect for human rights and denial of freedom of expression in the Peoples Republic of China as this affects the inhabitants of Tibet The latest example of the regimes policy towards Tibet is the repression of the monks who expressed their delight at the award of the Congressional Gold Medal to the Dalai Lama The Dalai Lama has also received the Nobel Prize and has been fighting for respect for human rights over several decades P We cannot allow Tibet or any other 21st century nation to be extinguished by a dictatorship a tyranny or by the sadistic desire to exert political dominance The House must say stop It must say stop to attacks on a culture that is deemed to be the most peaceful culture on earth As free people committed to the fundamental values of the European Union we should do all in our power to ensure that the people of Tibet can also come to understand the true meaning of the word freedom DE Mr President we are very shocked at the Russian Governments closure of all the regional offices of the British Council These regional offices have been sacrificed as a result of the worsening relations between Russia and the United Kingdom Can civil society in Russia expect nothing more than this kind of provocation P The murder of Alexander Litvinenko has still not been solved and Russia refuses to cooperate in the matter The chief suspect Andrei Lugovoi has been a member of the Duma since the end of 2007 The circumstances surrounding the death of Anna Politkovskaya have also still not been explained Is criticism being stifled under a mantle of secrecy or is it simply being eradicated P The EU must call on Russia to respect human rights and the rule of law We can set an example by naming our press office after Anna Politkovskaya PT Mr President following on from the third round of negotiations between the Polisario Front the only legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people and the Kingdom of Morocco which took place under the auspices of the United Nations on 8 and 9 January I must stress the current necessity and importance of demanding full respect for the inalienable right of the Sahrawi people to selfdetermination This is the only fair and lasting solution to this dispute and is also in accordance with international law and the UN resolutions The Moroccan authorities must be told to end their dilatory manoeuvring which is aimed at delaying and if possible boycotting the current negotiation process The Moroccan authorities must also be told to end the repression and colonisation of the occupied territories of the Western Sahara Mr President Mr Hu Jia an AIDS campaigner a human rights activist and nominee of this Parliament for the Sakharov Prize in 2007 was arrested in Beijing on 27 December 2007 by the Chinese authorities and charged with subversion P I am an admirer of the progress made in recent decades in China however the arrest of Mr Hu Jia by the Chinese sends out completely the wrong message one that is very difficult for us to understand Are the Chinese going to ignore the commitment they made to the international community when they promised to improve the human rights situation in China in return for the Beijing Olympics P We as a parliament need to respond very firmly to protect this man who is now incarcerated most probably for cooperating with the European Parliament when he gave testimony to the Subcommittee on Human Rights in November 2007 We also need to lend support to those campaigners in China seeking his release P Since diplomatic language alone would only be regarded as acquiescence in Chinese culture I believe we need a strong parliamentary resolution hopefully this week to protect Mr Hu Jia I urge you Mr President to raise the case of Mr Hu Jia with the Chinese authorities it is imperative they hear the views of this Parliament Mr President I rise to raise what may seem on the face of it a rather mundane issue the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive of 2000 in Ireland The sad fact is that this Directive is being implemented in Ireland by the Irish Government by charging schools for water usage Because most schools in Ireland are funded to a large extent by voluntary fundraising this essentially means that parents must raise the money to pay for the water P That would be bad enough but the Irish Government has decided to blame Europe for this decision when of course it is entirely a matter for the Irish Government as to what policy it implements in relation to implementing the Water Directive The sensitivity of the issue arises because we are having a referendum in Ireland to make a political decision and a cowardly political tactic to blame Europe for the Governments decision runs the risk of alienating all the parents in Ireland against Europe P This is in my view a serious matter and I would urge the President of Parliament and the VicePresident of the Commission who is here today to make it clear to the Irish Government and to make a public statement to the effect that they are free to charge or not to charge schools for water and that they should not be taking risks with the future of Europe with cowardly political tactics Mr President in some of our Member States it is possible for people to walk in off the street and receive training in the use of guns and indeed Magnum guns without any identification whatsoever or without having a gun licence I raise this here because there is evidence to suggest that organised criminals in Ireland are coming to parts of the European Union for such training and then returning to Ireland and murdering people through gangland murders Often innocent bystanders are murdered as well P I raise this because in November Parliament approved a new directive and that directive is now with the Council I urge the Council to approve this directive this month so that it will pass at first reading P Secondly I want to ask the Commission not to wait until this is transposed into national law in 27 Member States that could take up to two years but to start implementing some of the provisions one of which is to set up a contact group of the 27 Member States with the Commission to start working to counteract the illegal use of weapons I urge that this be done without further delay ET Mr President ladies and gentlemen P We have been keeping an eye on Georgia for some time now The Presidential elections are over and finally the result is clear P Revolution it is said devours its own children President Saakashvili was probably somewhat overcome by his fear of it The exercise of physical power by a country is the sign not of the countrys might but of its weakness P Objectively we should note that following the suppression of demonstrations there Georgia at least tried to hold democratic elections Democracy however is not a thing It is a way of thinking and cannot be removed one day or transplanted from one country to another P Considerable opposition has emerged in Georgia In the name of democratic progress we should help government circles to understand the nature of the essential ingredients of democracy P Georgia must find the strength within itself to step back from crisis Parliamentary elections are in the offing The country needs democratic reforms to continue and the people are expecting nothing less P It would be wrong of us in the European Union to stake things on one individual What we should do is support institutions provide expert assistance and honestly and openly point to any aspects which are incompatible with democracy P Finally I would like to say that what is happening in Georgia is perhaps also the key for Armenia Presidential elections are also in the offing there PL Mr President for the period 20082012 the European Commission has allocated Poland the right to emit only 208 million tonnes of carbon dioxide That is almost 30 less than the amount the Polish Government applied for Poland has appealed against this decision to the European Court of Justice but unfortunately it is not known when in the future the Court will rule on the matter The Polish economy therefore has to adjust to the low limit set P Cement works steel works and other undertakings have to cut their production Most importantly there will be a marked rise in the cost of electricity It is estimated that prices will rise by approximately 10 this year and by 20 over four years because the emission limits have also significantly affected the electricitygenerating industry P Imposing emission limits in this way and sharing the burden involved unfairly will not only slow down the development of new Member States such as Poland but it will also impact significantly on the cost of living for their citizens I wish to register a strong protest against this FR Mr President on Friday 11 January I was refused access to the LilleLesquin Detention Centre for foreigners My visit was part of the European Action Week against the detention of foreigners in Europe Mr President in July 2003 following in fact a request by the then President of our Parliament and VicePresident Onesta the French authorities were obliged to stipulate that the rules that apply to visits by Members of the French Parliament and Senators also apply to Members of the European Parliament P I would therefore ask you Mr President to speak to the French authorities once again to ensure that the commitments they made at that time are fully respected and in particular that Members of the European Parliament are treated in the same way as Members of the French Parliament This is all the more pertinent as the Members of this Parliament are currently examining a proposal for a directive on the return of thirdcountry nationals which could have very serious consequences for the detention of foreigners P I would add that unannounced visits to detention centres are aimed at preventing illtreatment which generally goes unpunished in France as indicated in the most recent report by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture RO I am speaking today to bring to your attention the position of Romanian farmers one year after Romanias accession P In Romania agriculture is still inefficient or not efficient enough and yet it is a vital occupation for most of the population Farmers make up a significant proportion of the working population but there is also a significant number of elderly farmers P In this context I welcome the Commissions decision not to activate the safeguard clause in this field however this is not enough P In 2008 European disbursements will amount to 25 of the European average only in 9 years time will Romania be able to reach that average P Over the last few years Romania has been quick to transpose the acquis in the qualitative health and phytosanitary fields P Adjustment costs can be a major obstacle to Romanian farmers taking advantage of the common agricultural policy Romania is the second largest agricultural producer in Central Europe after Poland and it is only by capitalizing on European funding that this potential can be intelligently exploited and put to good use SK The December session of the European Parliament was incorrectly informed that radio broadcasting for minorities in Slovakia is about to end and that the public service is closing down the Rádio Patria broadcasting in minority languages P Ladies and gentlemen the Slovak broadcasting service is not preparing any restrictions concerning Rádio Patria On the contrary since January 2007 Rádio Patria has for the first time in its history an independent broadcasting radius which covers 100 of the Slovak Republic It broadcasts daily 810 hours of highquality programming that consists of news journalism and culture That is more than ever before No other European public service offers a similar range of broadcasting services for national minorities P Mr Chairman it is sad when a Member of the European Parliament imagines that in a democracy one can say anything without having verified whether it is correct Such attacks result in tension and they are detrimental to the good name of the country SL Slovenia has taken over the Presidency of the European Union and the Prime Minister of its government who is also the President of the Council of the European Union has already made two assessments of the extremely dramatic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina which differ from the earlier assessments of the situation in that country He said that the situation was so dramatic as to be worse than in Kosovo P This provoked very heated reactions in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the institutions of the Federation and in those of Republika Srpska as well as among the population as a whole Even the High Representative Mr Lajčák himself had not given such a bleak assessment so far P It seems to me therefore that the assessment is unrealistic incorrect and unprofessional and does not provide the motivation for institutions or citizens of that country to be more successful in getting closer to the European Union It seems to me that at this point in time with issues as sensitive as Bosnia and Herzegovina we need more harmonisation among the institutions of the European Union PL In September 2006 the European Parliament appealed for an end to trade in seal products A record number of Members supported that declaration Unfortunately however despite such strong support and Parliaments subsequent adoption of the socalled Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals calling for a total ban on trade in seal products on the territory of the European Union no positive outcome has been achieved The ban has proved ineffective and has not put an end to trade in seal fur within the Union which remains one of the largest markets for such fur P Young seals just a few days above the age protected under the ban are hunted for commercial purposes and sold legally The hunting methods fail to comply with even the most elementary principles The animals are skinned whilst still alive and their bodies then dumped in the water This slaughter will continue as long as the European Commission does not impose a total ban on trade in all seal products Mr President we have two million drug addicts in the European Union We have a drug epidemic which has to be tackled headon P Fifteen years ago in Ireland drug addiction was confined to Dublin Now it is in every city town and village heroin cannabis cocaine People are dying every day in Ireland and within the EU from drug addiction P I welcome the current eightyear EU drug strategy But we have to ask ourselves realistically is it working We need to tackle the drug problem on all fronts First of all we need to cut off supply Secondly we need to try and persuade users to stop using drugs and to try and persuade people never to start using them by means of highprofile advertising campaigns to simply frighten people Last but by no means least we need more and better international cooperation RO 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue This is an opportunity for all 27 Member States to promote their culture history language and traditions P The Unions motto is ”Unity in diversity” and 2008 should make a real contribution to strengthening cohesion within the Union using intercultural dialogue as a basis P Over the centuries Romania has been under various influences Byzantine Russian AustroHungarian and Ottoman 86 of the Romanian population are Eastern Orthodox and Romania is the only Romancespeaking country where Eastern Orthodoxy is dominant P I would like to emphasize that 18 denominations enjoy official recognition in Romania However intercultural dialogue should include interdenominational dialogue P I would like to ask the 34 delegations of the European Parliament to enhance their promotion of European values on other continents in the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and to facilitate the knowledge of other cultures and traditions P It is my hope that the intercultural dialogue of 2008 will make an effective contribution to fostering peace one of the European Unions fundamental values DE Mr President the matter I wish to raise follows directly on from what Mrs Ţicău has just said the 2008 Year of Intercultural Dialogue I agree with this and respect the fact that the Conference of Presidents has taken certain decisions but I note with some regret that the religious representatives that are to speak here with the exception of the Pope all come from outside Europe P Do we not have enough religious leaders here in Europe who can be invited to address this House I therefore believe that it would make sense and indeed you have just touched on this Romania being a large Orthodox country to invite as speakers to this House not only the Pope and Protestant church leaders for there is also an intercultural dialogue between Christians but Orthodox representatives too I would therefore request that you also consider extending an invitation to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomaios as part of this Year of Intercultural Dialogue ES Mr President with this new year two new countries have joined the Euro zone and adopted our single currency This brings to the forefront once again a demand that should already be a reality in an advanced modern and progressive Union gender equality on new coins P This has been a constant theme in history women have scarcely ever been portrayed on newly minted coins Female figures contributions and work have never been given any symbolic recognition not only in this respect Gender equality is one of the values on which we are building the European Union and in that context equality should extend to all areas P It is important to recognise and support the action of so many women in different spheres science culture education politics whose work lives and names should be recognised studied and remembered In some countries such as my own Spain the Parliament has approved a proposal to this end P This Parliament and the Commission should take the necessary initiatives and recommend to all the Member States that they take the appropriate measures to ensure that when Euro coins are being minted equal consideration be given to references and images of both men and women Mr President one of my colleagues has suggested that a mundane matter has been brought up in this House and that is the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Ireland I think it is anything but mundane If it is mundane we need to have more debates on it because the Irish Government has got itself into hot water by blaming Europe for forcing it to charge schools for water when in fact the issue is how it is underfunding schools and how badly it is communicating and implementing this important piece of legislation P What is at risk is the view the Irish have of the European Union because we constantly blame Europe for decisions that we are unhappy with even though the government is party to the process of decisionmaking At a time when we are facing a referendum on the Reform Treaty not only are parents looking at the EU with a side glance and believing it is the problem but farmers and other lobby groups are also certainly not happy with the European Union at the moment P Therefore the Irish Government needs to explain fully how it is implementing this Directive it needs to fund the schools properly and it needs to answer the question of if and when domestic rates will be levied on Irish people That is what we need to know at this stage That concludes the item",

    "input": "CARS 21 A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework debate The next item is the report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis on behalf of the Committee on Industry Research and Energy on CARS 21 A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework rapporteur DE Mr President Commissioner Verheugen the report that we are discussing is in fact only a report on a report namely that which was drawn up by the Commission on the motor car of the future However on 19 December the European Commission adopted a proposal relating to future permitted CO2 emissions from passenger cars The public is therefore naturally interested to see how the European Parliament will react to this proposal and the extent to which the decisions taken by Parliament are consistent with others that have been adopted more recently We have just been debating and voting on the report presented by my colleague Chris Davies and it is therefore important that we should also be consistent I would like to say something about this at a later point for the CARS 21 report also covers many aspects that have nothing whatsoever to do with CO2 emissions P It is very important that we should concern ourselves in this House with the subject of motor vehicles Why Because we have been discussing the Lisbon agenda for years now and because all this while we have been debating the competitiveness of European industry Here we have a sector where we really are competitive In the premium market for example Europe has been setting the standard at international level More than 80 of the worlds topoftherange motor cars come from Europe The industry is one of the cornerstones of Europes economy and is also a key factor for European competitiveness P CARS 21 stands for Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st Century This is a Communication from the Commission which in 2005 set up the CARS 21 High Level Group in order to draw up proposals for a future regulatory framework for the EU automotive industry The aim of this exercise was to identify the adjustments that would have to be made to the automotive industry in order to keep this sector competitive in the years ahead It is not possible at this point to go into all the proposals that were made However the members of the European Parliaments Committee on Industry Research and Energy have drawn up a list of 89 of these I cannot deal with them all here but they relate to issues such as road safety environmental protection the internal market global trade research and innovation and many other things besides P Let me just single out a few of the aspects involved We need to complete the internal market for car tuning parts and spares for example It is unfair that German automotive tuning companies for instance are not allowed to sell products such as wheels in Italy because that country bans aftermarket tuning parts while Italian manufacturers on the other hand can export to any country they choose including Germany Here Europe needs a proper internal market for tuning and spare parts and we also need equal safety standards for the automotive tuning sector In addition we need to introduce an EUwide typeapproval system for there are blatant discrepancies in this area at the present time P Here is something else too we need a more simplified system for regulating typeapproval procedures for used vehicles acquired within the EU and elsewhere Some national states have set high obstacles and built up a massive bureaucracy that makes it very difficult for dealers and private buyers of used vehicles Europe needs a common regulatory system in this area This will also be an important tool when it comes to fleet renewal We are developing a climateprotection policy in many other areas and we need it here too which means we need to adjust and adapt P Another important issue concerns research funding The automobile industry needs more research money from the Member States The growing number of mandatory targets such as legislation on CO2 emissions requires continuous adaptation on the part of the car industry If Europe is to strengthen its position in this market both the Member States and the European Union will have to invest far more in vehicle research and not just in developing alternative drive systems but in other areas too such as energy storage We are already five to ten years behind our Asian competitors when it comes to research into storage battery technology P Now to the subject of CO2 in coordination with Chris Davies the rapporteur for the Committee on Environment Public Health and Food Safety we have once again set out a number of central parameters These are based on the concept of penalties instead of bans with vehicle weight being a key parameter but they are also centred on a realistic assessment of when the CO2 legislation can take effect Parliament has decided that the target date should be 2015 We have also voted for the figure of 125 grams as the basic emission target If I could now just make one comment to the Commission the penalty that you have specified in your proposal is 15 times higher than that imposed on CO2 emissions from chimneys This makes CO2 from vehicle exhausts 15 times more expensive than that which is emitted from chimneys For this reason we require a realistic rating What we have at present is too ambitious I should like to express my thanks to those colleagues who helped put this report together VicePresident of the Commission DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen the significance of CARS 21 extends far beyond the automotive sector It is also the model for Europes future industrial policy Here for the first time and by working closely with all the parties involved we are attempting to reach joint agreement on a longterm stable framework for the development of one of Europes key industries I am very proud to say that we have been successful in this P This is all based on a quite clear division of responsibilities We told the European car manufacturers that they could not expect us to introduce protectionist measures in order to safeguard them from the growing competition coming from other parts of the world We also said to them however that they could count on having a set of stable reliable and predictable framework conditions and more importantly sufficient time which is something Mr Chatzimarkakis just mentioned in order to prepare themselves for the mandatory requirements to come P I should at this point just like to say something about the position of the European car industry this is one of the very few market sectors in which Europe continues to be the undisputed global leader It is a key industry for Europe for technological development for growth and last but not least for employment I put up a vigorous defence against those voices in Europe who give the impression that there is something immoral even criminal in building purchasing and driving motor cars The car is part of our European way of life and it must be affordable it must be safe it must be reliable and it must be clean This is precisely what CARS 21 is all about P The European car industry is not opposed to the ambitious environmental targets that the European Commission has put forward in its proposal I should at this point also like to make something else quite clear I am not against them either The next stage in limiting CO2 emissions from private motor cars with no ifs ands or buts will be to set a European average of 120 grams per kilometre This is not inconsistent with the 125 grams mentioned by Mr Chatzimarkakis because 5 grams of this is to be achieved through the use of biofuels There is absolutely no disputing the fact that this will be our next target P I am also confident that the European car industry will benefit from such a legislatordriven innovation surge in that the sector will not only be producing the safest and bestquality vehicles but also the most environmentallyfriendly cars in the world I have not the slightest doubt that this will happen P In the course of the debate there were some suggestions made that I did not like at all namely and I will not put too fine a point on this the attempt to pit manufacturers of large cars against those who build smaller vehicles or to play off drivers of larger cars those who can afford and wish to own such vehicles against those who can only afford or prefer to drive smaller ones the motto being big car bad small car good P The French President Nicolas Sarkozy introduced a noteworthy argument into the debate when he wrote to the Commission President that the ability to spend a lot of money on a car in other words to buy a big and expensive vehicle did not entitle you to produce more pollution This is certainly an argument worth reflecting on P I do not live in France but I know that in France there are people who live in large castles and who need a lot of energy to heat these buildings I also know that in France there are people who live under the arches of bridges and who generate no heating costs whatsoever Where is the difference If it is immoral to drive a large car and therefore to cause more pollution than someone who drives a small vehicle then it is also immoral to live in a detached house and to generate more heating costs than someone who lives in a oneroom apartment P I would just like to draw attention to the fact that while this argument may seem quite convincing at first glance on closer inspection it would mean that the CO2 issue would in a roundabout way lead us down the road to pervasive lifestyle regulations in Europe That is something we certainly do not want and the Commission does not want it either We want to retain the entire range of models being produced by the European automotive industry and there is no reason why this should not be possible P I believe that in the consultation process that is about to commence we shall have to weigh up very carefully exactly what we can and want to ask of manufacturers consumers and other road users Ladies and gentlemen I have to say to you that we are expecting a very great deal of them Everything that we have already agreed on by way of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards which have already come into force will make European motor cars much more expensive P The regulations that we will be introducing to give pedestrians better protection in other words those measures directed towards vehicle design that will protect pedestrians more effectively in the event of their being involved in an accident will also cost a great deal of money The compulsory introduction of electronic stability control systems on European cars will be very expensive too and on top of this there is the cost of CO2 reduction We are doing this against the backdrop of a situation in which there is one particular sector of Europes automotive industry that is under attack from international competitors a sector that is already earning the least revenue where export opportunities are declining and where imports are exceeding exports namely the small and mediumsized vehicle market P I am quite concerned for the future of a large number of European manufacturers I am fully convinced that it is absolutely vital for all industrial products and this includes the motor car to be taken to the maximum level of ecofriendly development that is technically feasible However I am not of the opinion that we should do this in such a way and this applies to all industrial products not just cars that we compromise the international competitiveness of our industries P We have to be quite clear about one thing if by our policies and I say this with next weeks debate very much in mind we cause industries to abandon their European facilities and to set up production sites elsewhere in the world the effect on the environment will certainly not be a positive one for in these other places they will be then be producing their goods under much worse environmental conditions If the steel manufacturers were to move out of Europe to Kazakhstan believe me in that country the rules are far less strict than here in Europe The result would be an increase in emissions and at the same time tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost P I would appreciate it if these points were not forgotten in the course of the impassioned debate to come A modern European industrial policy and a modern European environmental policy can demonstrate that economy and ecology are not natural opposites and that it is possible to solve the ecological challenges of the future by way of a rational economic approach combined with modern technology P This was the subject discussed by all those involved in CARS 21 which is being debated here today and this was the ultimate outcome I believe the result is one that deserves the broad support of the European public at large P Applause draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade DE Mr President Commissioner Mr Chatzimarkakis I was responsible for drafting the relevant report for the INTA Committee Here we essentially focused on three key aspects P First of all we called on the Commission to ensure as a matter of urgency and with due care and diligence that all recommendations are examined to determine to what extent they impact on the multilateral stage the socalled Doha Round and on the bilateral agreements These bilateral agreements were of special interest to us as here in the case of Korea However we also focused attention on other countries such as India and the ASEAN states P It is important to ensure that market access is only opened up provided that we are also able to have appropriate guarantees from the other side This relates especially to the socalled nontariff trade barriers P Secondly we wish to see greater coordination when it comes to setting international agreements and international standards P Thirdly we would urgently recommend that when examining internal competition we do not lose sight of international competitive conditions which have changed considerably in recent years We now recognise that we have many more international competitors to deal with Mr President the automotive sector which provides the European economy with a significant number of jobs needs an ambitious framework that provides for coherent integrated measures in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy to cope with the new challenges P Our industry is the worlds largest producer of cars and second largest producer of lorries and it has good aftersales services As such it needs to assert its position and ensure that it is capable of meeting the mobility and transport requirements increasing productivity improving safety and benefiting the environment P To achieve this economic efficiency is crucial It is what is going to allow us to meet all of the objectives and guarantee affordable prices for fleet renewal ie purchasing vehicles and for maintaining them during their useful life The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has highlighted this aspect and expressed its support for efforts to improve competition and the protection of intellectual property rights and to improve the tax treatment of the sector P These points are to a large extent incorporated in the report and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur reporter of the opinion of the Employment and Social Committee LT I congratulate Mr Jorgo Chatzimarkakis for preparing this report The car industry really is one of the most important ones 23 million people work directly in it and another 1012 million in auxiliary sectors This makes 7 percent of all the people working in the industrial sector of the Community Members of the Community must take care of those people who could lose their jobs due to structural changes in advance and prepare for this appropriately Currently problems are solved only when they occur We have to ensure that Community funds allocated for enterprises undergoing reconstruction directly reach the employees Most especially it is necessary to support those who want to start their own business I have in mind the Globalisation Fund Humanity is the most important when various changes take place and our responsibility is to take care of the Communitys citizens protect them from unemployment and effectively use social guarantees Only this can help to gain the confidence of people draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety DE Mr President I would like to add to the debate by introducing two figures so that we all know what we are talking about There are now 700 million cars in the world at a time when oil prices are at 100 dollars Last week Tata Motors brought out a cutprice motor car that averages five litres per hundred kilometres but five litres is still a lot for such a small car P This all goes to show that in the years to come hundreds of millions of private cars will appear on the roads of the emergent nations China India other Asian countries South America and the African states In the light of such a scenario we are surely not planning to protect those European manufacturers who believe that they have to market twotonne limousines with fuel consumption rates of seven eight ten litres or more simply because we have a socalled competitive advantage in this area P I find the current debate to be nothing more than a fiasco Mr Ferber of the CSU recently threatened Commission President Barroso that his CDUCSU Group would not support a second mandate if Mr Barroso continued to back Mr Dimas in opposing the German automobile industry P Mr Verheugen if you pardon my saying so you surely cannot be cross with Mr Sarkozy Why are you cross Because he and Mr Prodi wrote a letter that sought to ensure that the Commission would not set the growth curve at 80 as the German car industry wanted but that a compromise would be found I find what Mr Prodi and Mr Sarkozy did in relation to this debate to be absolutely and completely legitimate Nor am I surprised that here again an FDP politician has naturally fallen into line behind the German car lobby P If I may say so Mr Chatzimarkakis your report falls behind what Chris Davies produced because instead of footprint you are now giving priority to vehicle weight and because instead of 125 grams based on vehicle technology you are now calling for an integrated target of 125 grams This means that today Parliament has backtracked somewhat As for the argument about a timeline what are we doing there By setting the date 2012 we are only trying to bring more quickly to market technology that already exists P The most important element is missing where is the target for 2020 Mr Verheugen you are calling for a solid framework How should I as a carindustry manager know which direction to go in when Europes policymakers fail to set any terms of reference specifying how energy efficient I should be by 2020 There is no mention of this either in the Commissions proposal or in yours P If this Parliament is to do anything when it comes to the report on the legislation then it should produce a proposal on where we need to be by 2020 That is what we need stable longterm planning Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Mr President I want to start my speech by agreeing for once with Mr Turmes This report is all about giving a crucial industry a stable framework within which to meet the societal demands that we are placing on it whether they concern environment or safety Whether Mr Dimas has achieved that and done a proper impact assessment in comparison with what is in the CARS 21 report I beg to differ One of the things I would like to ask Commissioner Verheugen to do is to take a message to Mr Dimas and ask him to explain how the process that he is currently using to develop this regulation is in any way compatible with what is in the CARS 21 proposal P I declare an interest in this because I was a member a working member of the High Level Group This is the third report The High Level Group made its report the Commission made a very good response accepting most of the recommendations of the stakeholders and now this Parliament thanks to the good work of Mr Chatzimarkakis is going to convincingly endorse those conclusions P But there is one other group that characteristically is conspicuously missing from this debate and that is the Member States One of the most important recommendations of CARS 21 is an integrated approach Member States have a major stake in this so why are they not here this evening They are the ones who behave idiosyncratically in their national regulations and undermine the achievement of that stable framework that internal market that achievement of the environmental and safety goals that we want to achieve those targets of reducing road deaths where we have very ambitious targets and where they can make big investments in infrastructure and driver training Why are they not here P We need to send a clear message to them One of the things that we ask from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is for this Parliament to take an initiative in getting other national parliamentarians together in this House to talk in the framework of CARS 21 about how they as national and local politicians are going to contribute to these overall goals of achieving a competitive car industry with the highest possible technology and preserving and developing jobs and employment while achieving the goals that we all want to meet in terms of science safety and environmental improvements P Applause draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I wanted to include a few suggestions in the opinion on A Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework in the 21st Century given its high strategic value for growth and jobs in the Union but also in view of the need to do more by adapting vehicles and infrastructure and applying technological innovation to make European roads safer P I believe that all of this can indeed be done by reducing emissions but an integrated approach should have been pursued to this end as proposed by the CARS 21 Group I do rather get the impression that the Commission has somewhat disregarded this approach I particularly deplore the failure to emphasise the policies needed to attain the accepted costbenefit principle P Furthermore I note that in order to achieve the aim of increasing the use of biofuels it is vital to promote the necessary locallybased facility network enabling citizens to obtain supplies Otherwise this aim will not be achieved I will conclude by saying that I had hoped and still hope that judicious approaches will be taken to ensure that the cost of technological adaptation can be met on a level playing field guaranteeing free competition and genuine competitiveness within the EU As a matter of fact I have also drawn the attention of my fellow Members and the Commission to the importance of maintenance but with little success Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs Mr President the Committee on Legal Affairs supports the CARS 21 initiative which we believe was an exemplary example of stakeholder involvement P We say yes to the integrated approach which we believe is fundamental to the success of this initiative But like Mr Harbour I would raise the question about Member States commitment given their unilateral desire on occasion to legislate or implement fiscal regimes which undermine the integrated approach P Yes to simplification replacing 38 directives with UN regulations as long as we are not seen as abdicating our right to legislate should we need to and yes to the development of technologically driven solutions such as ECOR But I would hope that the Commission could take more action as Ms Mann has suggested on intellectual property rights particularly in relation to China We would like to see a proper implementation of the Regulation on Motor Vehicle Distribution in the EU and we believe it is fundamental to address nonharmonised implementation the EndofLife Vehicles Directive P We have to improve crossborder inspections of vehicles and crossborder enforcement of traffic rules in other Member States because otherwise the whole situation becomes very disparate But like Mr Turmes I believe that what we should be looking for is a framework which extends to 2020 and beyond on behalf of the PPEDE Group FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen I would like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen on having taken the initiative to create a highlevel group CARS 21 to examine the European automotive industry P In 2003 several Ministers for Industry including myself were in favour of this new method which involves examining a given industrial sector in detail in order to find the appropriate solutions for it You will recall that this method was successfully applied to the textiles sector for example It enables us to involve the stakeholders and to achieve an integrated approach P I have just one wish for the future representation that gives greater consideration to the diversity of professions covered by the sector and even greater involvement of the European Parliament P That being said I would like to mention three of the proposals put forward in the excellent report by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis The first is the importance of stressing that the automotive sector is a source of jobs competitiveness growth and innovation and thus calling for greater investment in research and development particularly in the areas of hydrogen motors fuel cells or hybrids The message is clear and research into vehicle technologies will certainly have to be one of the priorities of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology P Secondly as regards the contribution of the automotive industry to the fight against global warming the targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions are in line with the Davies report we adopted in October We must give the industrial sectors time to prepare As a result I believe that it would not be wise to bring forward the 2015 deadline Nonetheless the fight against greenhouse gas emissions must also involve tax measures that act as an incentive for fleet renewal P Finally I am pleased that our rapporteur calls for the creation of an internal market for custom and tuning parts and for greater efforts to combat the import of counterfeit spare parts The safety of the citizens and the survival of thousands of European SMEs are at stake P In conclusion ladies and gentlemen I would just like to point out that it is essential to take into account the pressure on the European automotive industry and the everincreasing competition P I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis for his excellent collaboration with the shadow rapporteurs and congratulate him on having achieved this very dynamic result which augurs well for this important sector of our economy on behalf of the PSE Group DE Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen setting up the CARS 21 High Level Group was exactly the right thing to do The results speak for themselves We had two representatives of Parliament in this Group Malcolm Harbour and Garrelt Duin and they produced some very good work As the shadow rapporteur for this report in the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety I only wish to deal with the environmental issues However as a member of the Committee on Industry Research and Energy too I am firmly convinced that preserving and increasing the competitiveness of the European automotive industry is closely tied to the question of how ecofriendly and environmentally sustainable vehicles stamped made in Europe will be in the future P I therefore welcome the fact that we were quick in implementing the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards for motor cars and that the Commission proposal for a Euro 6 standard for goods vehicles has now been put forward This sourcebased legislation will enable us to help the towns cities and communities of Europe to meet the particulate emission targets that have been set and in this way to provide a better air quality P However it remains a mystery to me that when it comes to emissions reduction people are always trying to postpone the 2012 deadline set for the introduction of the CO2 legislation and move it back to 2015 That is not right We have had the Bali Climate Conference where Europe put forward a very assertive front However when it comes to the actual legislation we always take a nifty step backwards Car manufacturers have known since 1995 that something had to be done in the area of research and development to produce environmentfriendly models I think that a setup time of 12 years would be sufficient to achieve the 120 gkm target by 2012 and this includes any complementary measures That is something quite important P Climate change will certainly not wait for us which means that we have to act now It is also important to ensure that CO2 output will have peaked by the year 2015 so that we can then set about reducing these emissions Here every industry will have to play its part including the vehicle manufacturers on behalf of the ALDE Group Mr President the car industry should have reduced its emissions by a great deal more than it has but we are where we are and it takes time to achieve change economically so I welcome the rapporteurs proposal to set a target of 125 g by 2015 to bring it in line with the vote of this Parliament last October P I think it is ambitious but it is achievable And to a significant degree it now reflects the Commissions proposals for only a very gradual phasein of penalties after 2012 But I am sorry that the rapporteur has proposed that the target values should be based on weight because this removes an incentive to reduce the weight of cars and it goes counter to the vote we had in October So please let us be consistent In its proposals the Commission has recognised that footprint may have great merit it simply says that we have not got the data to establish the credentials for that yet so let us get the data as fast as we can and keep the options open P We do not want to fight our business leaders and our entrepreneurs On the contrary if we are to combat climate change and reduce the threat that now hangs over the survival of billions of people in the poorest parts of this planet we have to get them to accept responsibility for their actions I was wrong in November when I claimed here that Michael OLeary the boss of Ryanair had said that he did not give a toss for the environment so long as he could stuff his pockets and those of his airline full of gold That may be the impression his scorn for environmentalists sometimes creates but I apologise and withdraw the claim and look forward to taking up his offer of a debate But if we are to tackle the problem of climate change we need people like Mr OLeary and his counterparts in the car industry on side working with us pushing the boundaries of innovation and leading from the front on behalf of the GUENGL Group CS Mr Chairman ladies and gentlemen I am convinced that in this case the rapporteur has done a great deal of work and demonstrated considerable skill in how to negotiate and how to compromise This concerns in particular the matter of emissions reduction in the automotive industry We must be realistic and keep in mind that the industry belongs among the top industries in Europe and at the same time is one of the key employers As mentioned earlier the industry provides more than two and a quarter million jobs and millions more in related fields In my opinion reducing emissions in this industry will be a very difficult task In my view the result here is a respectable and realistic document It is important too for it to support the endeavour to simplify significantly the legislation affecting the automotive industry there are more than 200 regulations in existence today In this vein I have tried in my role as shadow rapporteur to support the report with my amendments Their main objectives were to prevent the ambitious plans from tripping up the development of the field in Europe and our ability to compete in the world SK Please allow me as an introduction to thank the rapporteur Mr Chatzimarkakis for his excellent report which takes into consideration and pragmatically addresses all aspects of the regulatory framework which are so important to the future of the automotive industry P When we talk in this report about the European automotive industrys ability to compete under the conditions of global development we have to take into consideration above all those aspects that could significantly limit this ability I thought originally that it was not necessary to remind the European Commission of the significance of this industry to the economic and social development of the European Union but since the Commission came up with the proposal of setting emission standards for new private cars I am no longer so sure If that is correct then the Commission would obviously pay more respect to the majority view of the European Parliament as well as to the views of the expert groups who are advocating a more integrated approach P The European Parliament is also critically considering the time within which the European automotive industry is able to meet the technologically ambitious emissions targets such in a way that would have the minimum impact on the European industrys ability to compete The European Parliament expressed this clearly in the report by Mr Davies and in this very report by majority vote the committee expressed its belief that the car companies could reach the CO2 level of 125 gkm by 2015 If we really hope to reduce emissions throughout the automotive sector we must have a more comprehensive understanding of these issues P The proposed step would definitely lead to a slowdown in the exchange of old cars besides other negative impacts such as the inability of less wealthy citizens to purchase new cars This aspect would be most likely to prevail in the new Member States where the level of exchanging old cars for new is for economic reasons low This certainly would not contribute to the reduction of CO2 quite the contrary NL Mr President transport emissions are responsible for a fifth of greenhouse gas emissions The number of cars per thousand inhabitants is increasing fast all over the world so cars really must become sustainable However this is a message that is scarcely to be heard in the response of the Commission to the CARS 21 report and in the report itself The document speaks about making cars cleaner and the competitiveness of the automotive industry but it makes no connection between these two things while it is obvious that sustainable and economical cars are the future P Indian and Chinese car manufacturers are sweeping the world with small economical clean and cheap cars The European automotive industry meanwhile is fighting a rearguard action to be allowed to emit even more CO2 That is unfortunate for the environment but it is also unfortunate for employment in the European Union The CARS 21 High Level Group was a missed opportunity to put in place a vision of a sustainable automotive industry a vision that provides an answer to the real challenges P Innovation is the key word here In the United States a hydrogen highway is being laid and the market is being prepared for electric vehicles Where are the European initiatives Some car manufacturers have the prototypes ready but there are still no hydrogen vehicles on the road It is time for governments and industry to unite and work together in order to make rapid progress Research alone is not enough P The settingup of high level groups is an excellent idea in theory but unfortunately CARS 21 was dominated by a conservative branch of industry It is really important that the composition of high level groups does justice to the challenges we are facing Millions of new cars are going to come on to the market over the next few years and it would really help if they were clean and economical DE Mr President car manufacturing is one of Europes key industries It employs some 12 million people it represents innovation and growth and it produces something designed to provide individual mobility It must therefore be our aim to see that the European car industry maintains its global leadership and its competitiveness At the same time however we need to remember that in todays global economy there is a very fine line between incentives for innovation and penalties for economic actions and that at the end of the day we are still exporting the best products in the world and not just outsourcing our production locations P I essentially want to focus on the CO2 issue which is without doubt one of the most important aspects of the subject we are discussing here Lifestyle criticism which Mr Verheugen mentioned has long been an unpleasant aspect of the European climate debate It is very in to criticise individual lifestyles Claude Turmes has just done as much The thing is if we were to withdraw all the twotonne limousines from the market as he would dearly like to do the CO2 reductions would scarcely be measurable but the damage to the national economy would be enormous P Let me now comment on the proposed CO2 regulation that is currently on the table Mr Verheugen has said quite clearly in this respect that he has no wish to introduce legislation that would constitute a lifestyle criticism However when I look at the penalty payments now being proposed for minimal deviations from the prescribed limits I tend to be of the view that this is precisely what the Commission has done In actual fact the regulation that we are discussing and approving here today is hostile to innovation for the money that the car manufacturers will have to pay out is needed for innovation and research Mr President the car of today is in some ways very much the same as that of 100 years ago but at the same time it is extremely different regarding security efficiency and its effect on the environment This proves one thing the strength of competition develops technology at a pace we cannot imagine It also underlines the need for Europe to have a competitive car industry if we are to contribute to the global agenda and to better standards for the environment in the global economy because if we do not we will not be able to influence that development P Those who call for a policy that would decrease the competitiveness of the European car industry do not contribute to a better environment it is important to state that It is also important to state that the target of 125 g as stated in the report is acceptable and a step forward P But the important thing is not to discuss emissions from individual cars big or small because we need big cars and we will need small cars they play a different role in different parts of our Union in our countries What we need is an overall development that decreases emissions in all sorts of cars Therefore it is important to support new cars because they are better to support better road systems better transport systems better fuels and better engines That can only be done by a competitive European car industry and that can only be achieved if we have the right policies to balance the environment and competitiveness and this report makes a good contribution towards that RO First of all I would like to extend my congratulations to the Rapporteur for the work done on this report P I consider this to be an extremely important debate P The European Union can have the most dynamic knowledgebased economy only if it invests enough in research and especially if the results can be integrated into industrial production P Climate change is one of the major challenges of the century P In major urban areas traffic and pollution constitute a problem for 66 of European citizens and 70 of the citizens expect the Union to show active involvement in dealing with these problems P The automotive industry should be capable of delivering less polluting products however the industry needs support in its research activities and it is especially important that any constraint should take into account the time required to develop new types of cars from concept to design manufacturing testing and marketing P We should also take into consideration market demand and in particular the citizens buying power In this context I believe that Member States should be encouraged to devise tax incentives for endusers so as to encourage them to invest in greener cars P Such a system was introduced in Romania as early as 2003 with very good results P The development of the European automotive industry will lead to the preservation and creation of a significant number of jobs SV Mr President I thank the rapporteur for a good piece of work on an important and sensitive matter We all know how important the car industry is in the EU Our car industry not least in my home country is a leading contender in the fields of development research performance the environment and safety A successful car industry is important to the Union We are talking about jobs and growth but also about responsibility for our environment for the global climate P The Commission proposes farreaching legislation focused on compulsory reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from engine exhausts improved vehicle technology and use of biofuels The rapporteur has misgivings about targets which are so difficult for industry to attain that they can jeopardise the competitiveness of companies but we have heard that before in this debate I have also heard such arguments back home I can understand and share those misgivings but I believe that it would be unfortunate in this situation if Parliament were to lower the level of ambition I am quite confident that the EU car industry can cope with targets set at high levels through research and development It has demonstrated its ability to do so in the past P The people of our countries do not want to pay too much for their cars but they also know that we must get to grips with climate change and that we need to act quickly DA Mr President I should like to join the many Members who have thanked the rapporteur for the excellent report we are discussing here It is clear that given so many cars the increasing mobility and an increasing desire to give even more people the opportunity to drive the issue of emissions is a key problem that we shall have to address P Carbon dioxide is not toxic to humans in itself and a little more CO2 in the atmosphere would actually make plants grow slightly faster It is however ruinous to the climate and so it is important that we do what we can to reduce CO2 emissions In my opinion we must place greater reliance on research to enable us to develop engines that run at a significantly higher temperature than is currently the case possibly using ceramic or other materials and especially by means of a much more widespread use of software for control purposes P I believe that the objectives laid down will be easy to achieve There is no reason to believe that given a concentrated targeted effort and substantial research resources Europe should not be able to achieve the objectives it has set itself and make itself the leading industry within the automotive sector that it already is ES Mr President I would like to congratulate Mr Chatzimarkakis on his report as it urges the Commission to set ambitious yet realistic targets It also follows some of the CARS 21 recommendations such as the integrated approach to the reduction of CO2 emissions the need to ensure appropriate leadtimes and the protection of the internal and external competitiveness of the European industry P I would like to highlight a number of issues The first of these is the fact that the road safety objectives are a key element and here too we need an integrated approach that incorporates vehicle technology improvements infrastructure measures and education and information P As regards trade and in particular the negotiations with Korea it is important to ensure that Korea abolishes the existing nontariff barriers and does not create new ones It is also essential to emphasis the crucial role played by the better regulation principles ie proper impact assessments the costeffectiveness principle or appropriate leadtimes in creating a competitive regulatory framework for the automotive industry P In this respect the roadmap is an integral part of the final CARS 21 report and should be respected P There are clearly some structural problems and of course it is necessary to establish general conditions to make the automotive industry in the EU sustainable P The only way to do that is to enable our industry to remain in the forefront of technological ecological and social innovation with the support of a highly skilled labour force Consequently one very important aspect is the commitment to education and training for workers in the car industry Community environmental road safety and energy efficiency legislation requires proper training for workers to enable them to adapt more easily to changes both of a technical nature and as regards regulation and to enjoy the same or better job prospects P In addition in order to guarantee the future of the European automotive industry it is crucial to strengthen in the Union the rights of workers and their trade unions to information and consultation One example that illustrates this is the recent agreement between Ford and the General Workers Union in the Valencia factory which will allow new investment for modernisation and for the production of new models P Participation strengthens the sector and in cases where restructuring is necessary can mitigate its negative effects As a result it is essential to emphasise the need to reinforce with the corresponding revision the Directive on the European Works Council NL Mr President Commissioner Verheugen ladies and gentlemen rapporteur tomorrow in Brussels the 86th car showroom will open its doors and the environmentallyfriendly car will take centre stage It is clear that both the car manufacturers and consumers have finally been convinced of the urgent need for a change of course It is also clear that a change of course and change of mentality will only be possible will only be achievable through compulsory measures and this will require measures in a number of different areas P Anyone who is still thinking defensively is wrong in my opinion A significant number of European and other mediumsized cars already meet the new standard of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre Even German cars Mr Verheugen the new Golf TDI 1900 is already on 115 grams per kilometre so it really is possible in Germany too and I think that we have to vigorously pursue that route further Environmentallyfriendly technology that is what it is about It is a sector that has huge potential for growth and offers huge opportunities It is good therefore that the Commission is forcing the issue We need to invest now as you have already said Commissioner in order to lead the world in this field P I have checked the figures the Seventh Framework Programme contains over EUR 4 billion of loans for the transport sector That is a great deal of money but in the view of Parliament it is in Mr Chatzimarkakiss report not enough to fulfil our high ambitions That is why we are asking for more loans to be earmarked for research into new technologies at the budget review P In conclusion ladies and gentlemen it is also high time that the Council moved more swiftly especially in the tax field There is a proposal before the Commission to couple vehicle tax to the emission of harmful substances What are the national governments waiting for They are not represented here unfortunately but I hope that the message will get through to them Why are the governments waiting to take action on this proposal It is the only way to really get the environmentallyfriendly car adopted in the short term PL Mr President we are all fully aware that the European Unions car industry is one of the most important sectors of its economy producing 19 million vehicles a year Most importantly it also accounts for 23 million jobs A further 10 million jobs in associated sectors are indirectly dependent on this industry It is worth noting that it is not only the quantity but probably essentially the quality of the jobs provided that accounts for the key role the car industry plays in the economic life of the European Union The best way of illustrating this success is by reference to the EUR 35 billion annual export trade surplus and the high level of innovation P Despite all this optimistic data the European car industry is facing some very serious challenges P I fully support the final report of the CARS 21 High Level Group and the European Commissions communication on the subject Nonetheless I should like to call for further action aimed at creating a genuine single internal market in cars Individual Member States are still applying different tax regimes concerning cars either by charging duty or through other registration charges perpetuating the inequalities between consumers P I welcomed the compromise achieved in the European Parliament concerning the socalled repair clause because it most certainly represents a step towards unifying provisions in this area thus contributing to better lawmaking The car industry should be relieved of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens especially as regards increasing the number of international provisions already in existence P Pursuant to the principles of better lawmaking a proper impact assessment and the principle of optimising costs and benefits should always be taken into account when creating a competitive legal environment for the car industry In view of the ongoing technological development in this sector I support the Commissions action introducing a review and revision mechanism to ensure that legal provisions do not slow down the technical advances that are constantly being achieved P The European car industry is one of the most competitive of its kind in the world Nonetheless its position may be threatened if its competitors resort to unfair trading practices or fail to respect intellectual property rights P I should like to call on the Commission to take more consistent and effective action to ensure respect for intellectual property rights and their implementation in all parts of the world notably China The importance of the strategic partnership with China is beyond dispute but European intellectual property has to be protected This is absolutely vital NL Mr President I think that the frantic attempts of the auto lobby to get absolutely essential environmental measures postponed have been successful Time after time members of this Chamber appear to be susceptible to this lobby first Mr Davies and now Mr Chatzimarkakis P Waiting until 2015 to substantially reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles is highly irresponsible What is more it is technically possible to achieve 120 grams per kilometre by 2012 and the automotive industry itself is solely to blame for the present situation After all attempts to reduce emissions voluntarily have failed miserably It turns out that only setting compulsory standards will work P We expect the citizens of Europe to make sacrifices to save our climate Why should we not demand as much of the automotive industry Thus there must be a maximum 120 grams of CO2 emissions per kilometre by 2012 DE Mr President I wanted to direct a further question to Mr Verheugen Mr Verheugen in your speech you said that the rules that we are now laying down for the car industry would as good as mean the relocation of European industry You repeatedly referred to the pressure being applied to the European automotive industry Could you perhaps subsequently make it clear in your presentation that the regulations that we are introducing will of course apply equally to all motor manufacturers worldwide This naturally means that the Japanese car industry will also have to comply with these rules P Moreover in this respect let me just add a further comment last week you presented us with the lead market initiatives Does this not then mean that in the car manufacturing sector in particular we are positioning Europe as the market that now has the most demanding legislation and that we are therefore specifically creating a lead market for efficient motor cars even allowing for environmental constraints and oil supply problems Member of the Commission DE Mr President I would like to respond immediately to the question from Mr Turmes My comment had nothing whatsoever to do with the car industry but was one of principle on the connection between industrial policy and environmental policy between economy and ecology You will of course be aware of my viewpoint we in Europe have to set the highest standards However it makes no sense to run so far ahead of things that industry migrates away and we begin to export pollution and as a result import unemployment These remarks were not related in any way to the car industry There I fully share your view that we not only have the opportunity but also the obligation to establish Europe permanently as the lead market for environmentallyfriendly cars P As I now have the floor I would like to point something out to Mrs Corbey it is not correct to assert that the Chinese are building cars that are more environmentally friendly than those made in Europe and that these are now flooding the European market in their millions The few hundred Chinese cars that are currently to be found in Europe are of extremely dubious quality not exclusively but also from an environmental viewpoint The same can be said for the peoples car the Tata that is now being manufactured in India If you relate the weight of these vehicles to their fuel consumption you will see that their performance is significantly worse than that of the cars currently being built in Europe P The same applies to the US it is now quite unrealistic to make the accusation that American cars are more environmentally friendly than European ones If you think about it for just a moment you will soon come to the conclusion that this cannot be true When it comes to modern technology the only working hydrogenpowered cars in the world are to be found in Europe Nobody else is spending more on research in this area than we are P I would like to close with a thought that will perhaps unite us all I am able to remain quite composed throughout this entire debate for I really do believe that we are on the right road because I know that the European car manufacturers and more importantly the European automotive suppliers for they really are the driving force behind European industry have not been asleep in recent years but have been working on a whole series of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to achieve our objectives P Mr Turmes you are perfectly correct and I would have been happy to support such a proposal the industry would be delighted and so would I as the Commissioner responsible for industry if we could now say what the next stage in the process should be This is precisely what we have set out in CARS 21 namely a longterm stable and predictable regulatory framework This can be as ambitious as possible provided that it is long term and provided it is stable rapporteur DE Mr President I should like to begin by thanking my fellow Members for this truly fair and open debate It has been conducted on a high level and has covered the issues of climate protection innovation and as we have been aware of at all times especially when it comes to our fellow Members from the GUENGL job security These are three areas where we all have to find common agreement P I should also like to express my thanks to Claude Turmes for his various clarifications and suggestions However I would like to say quite openly that I consider the remarks made by Mrs Liotard to be unfair It is not all about running after some lobby group or other It is about fighting fervently for a policy that represents a key market for us in Europe Here I am fully behind the Commissioner and I am also fully behind you too Claude P I would maintain that you have been unfair here Mrs Liotard It is not right that you should call this lobbyism I would at this point just like to quote from the great German sociologist Max Weber who said that politicians must have passion and I am actually trying to show some of this now but at the same time they must have a sense of responsibility and a sense of proportion The latter sometimes seems to get lost in debates of this kind with all the hysteria about climate change P Keeping a sense of proportion means ensuring that the great objectives that we want to achieve are also feasible I would now just like to mention my colleague Chris Davies for I am just a little proud of him There is no one in the ALDE Group who is greener or more ecologically minded than Chris Davies Nonetheless he has had the sense of proportion in his report to call for practical limits and deadlines That is what all this is about we should not be giving the people of Europe the runaround but should be doing things that are really achievable P I am pleased to see that the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety adopted the report by a large majority I also want to thank the members of the Committee on Industry Research and Energy for having adopted this report by a fairly large majority and I hope that tomorrow many of the Members will vote for it here in this House The debate is closed P The vote will take place tomorrow P Written statements Rule 142 in writing HU As Peoples Party shadow rapporteur on the Committee on the Environment Public Health and Food Safety I would like to emphasise that the report does not deal with the car of the twenty first century but regulations for a competitive automotive industry in the twenty first century P By now motor traffic has become the second largest CO2 emitting sector and is responsible for 12 of all the CO2 emissions throughout the Union The rate of increase is alarming for this sector increased 26 between 1990 and 2004 making it 265 of the Unions total energy consumption P The car manufacturers voluntary agreements on emissions reduction are not working and the Unions regulations are powerless since they can only bring the vehicle sector into the Emissions Trading Scheme after 2013 if at all P The only success is that the average consumption by cars was 124 less in 2004 than in 1995 This is entirely due to technological innovation as cars have been continuously increasing in size and power P Both the Member States and car buyers have to make further efforts There have to be on the one hand tax incentives for fuelefficient and low CO2 emission vehicles to gain a market presence and support for manufacturers for targeted development On the other hand we have to improve the information available to purchasers update and extend the labelling system for light trucks harmonise energy efficiency classes and propose annual running costs Finally we have to sell the idea of ecodriving and training run attentiongrabbing campaigns and adopt regulations for obtaining a driving licence",

    "input": "Abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions debate The next item is the report A60513 by Mr Costa on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions in implementation of Article 793 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and Regulation EC No 8522004 of the European Parliament and the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs Transport aspects C600862007 VicePresident of the Commission DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen I should first like to thank Mr Costa for having drawn up this report Reducing the administrative burden resulting from EU regulations is one of the most effective ways in which we can improve the regulatory environment for Europes 24 million businesses This initiative therefore makes an important contribution towards achieving our ambitious targets as part of the partnership for Growth and Jobs P The Commission therefore welcomes Parliaments support for a rapid adoption of this urgent procedure This will help eliminate those unnecessary elements of the documentation required when transporting goods across national borders within the EU The measure in question will remove those regulations which have now become obsolete and which in fact date back to the year 1960 P According to the regulations still in force carriers are required to provide a wide range of information on tariffs price agreements and transport arrangements as soon as the goods they are transporting cross national borders within the Community The simplified system being proposed by the Commission will significantly ease the administrative burden on some 300 000 European haulage companies and it has been estimated that it will save these operators a total of at least EUR 160 million a year not a bad result at all P As far as the procedure is concerned the Commission acknowledges that the European Parliament has divided into two separate parts the socalled omnibus proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending both Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions and Regulation EC No 8522004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs P I should like to state that the Commission will in future prefer the socalled omnibus approach in other words using a single proposal to cover several measures designed to reduce any unnecessary administrative burden There are two reasons for this firstly it is clear that the aim is not to alter the substance of the legislative text in question but merely and I repeat the word merely to remove the unnecessary bureaucratic workload and secondly such an approach will speed up the rate at which measures of this kind can be discharged P The Commission therefore hopes that both legislative bodies can now make rapid progress with the second part of the proposal namely that which deals with the hygiene of foodstuffs P Thank you all for your attention rapporteur IT Mr President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen I could in fact repeat much of what has already been said by Commissioner Verheugen but shall avoid doing so This is a commendable initiative smallscale measures often conceal major results and this is one such case P We are obviously dealing here with rules that were enacted in a different Europe The basic Regulation dates back to 1960 when our countries were separate and when rules on hygiene and food could mask discrimination and obstacles to competition That is why it was necessary to indicate which road to take and where to cross borders Many things needed to be said and many details spelled out but since much of this no longer serves any purpose it is a good idea for us to divest ourselves of these rules and adapt them P We are aware that all food hygiene legislation is a sensitive matter and therefore very timeconsuming That is the reason behind this solution which I think makes a good deal of sense namely to separate out the transport rules which are easier to accept and I hope to implement P The committee which I have the honour of chairing accepted my report unanimously I take this as an encouraging sign that the House will do likewise tomorrow enabling appropriate steps to be taken in the very near future P This is a case of virtuous simplification It is simplification which at the same time as simplifying adapts to current circumstances and new ways of conveying information rendering many bureaucratic procedures unnecessary and perhaps enabling us to devote more of our attention to making sure that food is transported hygienically from one part of the Union to another on behalf of the PSE RO The Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions requires land rail or waterborne freight carriers operating within the Community to provide information on their rates applicable agreements terms of carriage as well as the necessary documentation P Thus operators are forbidden to discriminate by applying differential rates with reference to the same product being carried in the same transportation system on the same route but discriminations are created according to the country of destination or of origin P This is a very important Regulation but as it had been in force since 1960 it needed updating The draft amendment simplifies existing legislation and ensures more stability in the conditions applicable to the transportation of goods P According to the statistics provided by the Commission it is true as the Commissioner said that the Regulation will affect or will have some bearing on the activity of some 300 thousand transport operators and this amendment will reduce Europewide administrative expenditure by some €160 millionyear P The European Parliament intends to reduce by 25 the administrative burden on enterprises by the year 2012 The proposal for the amendment of the two Regulations as put forward to the Commission is among the measures designed to achieve that objective P It is true however that the Committee on Transport was notified in the codecision procedure which is contrary to Article 733 of the Treaty Hence the proposal put forward by Mr Costa as rapporteur was adopted unanimously DE Mr President it would be negligent of me if I were not to reiterate on behalf of our Group what the Commissioner said in his opening words namely that our Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism has truly fulfilled his remit as committee chairman in dealing with this fairly unspectacular but nevertheless important regulatory issue of air transport services especially because he succeeded in obtaining unanimous support within the committee P We hope that the unanimity of our vote has made his life and his work much more agreeable and I just wanted to emphasis this a second time Mr President I congratulate the Commission and you do not hear that very often from up here do you But this is a rare example of a report that is on the right road to Damascus P We insist on debating this proposition for it seeks to cut regulation It admits that small businesses are being weighed down by unnecessary legislation some of it going back to 1960 The explanatory statement says that these unnecessary administrative burdens hamper economic activity and have a negative impact on the competitiveness of enterprises I could not agree more why stop here Why only limit unnecessary paperwork from 10 employees or less Let us go the whole hog and apply it to the whole of the foodstuffs industry Go on make a bonfire of another 100 000 pieces of legislation While you are at it scrap the Commission Parliament and the Council I am serious By cutting regulatory burdens you enable the nations of Europe to throw off the shackles that will otherwise inevitably turn us into the economic alsorans of the 21st century rapporteur IT Mr President ladies and gentlemen I just wanted to say that we are using more words than necessary here P It seems to me that we are fully in agreement the amendments needed to be made and go in the right direction it is right to separate the two sets of legislation in order to abolish discriminatory transport conditions My only recommendation would be that I repeat tomorrow what I said in committee in the hope of achieving the same outcome a unanimous or almost unanimous vote on this proposal The debate is closed P The vote will take place on Tuesday",

    "input": "US antimissile defence system debate The next item concerns the declaration of the Council and the Commission on the US antimissile defence system PresidentinOffice SL The Council did not discuss the installation of the US antimissile defence system on the territory of the European Union Therefore I am sorry that I am unable to give the Councils opinion on this matter but I would like to remind you that the decision on any installation of any armed forces or military equipment rests within the national competence of each Member State For that reason the Member States make decisions on such matters independently P Allow me to clarify there have not been any discussions so far between the European Union and the United States of America on the installation of the antimissile system Also neither party has planned for a possible cooperation in this area The Council of the European Union did not therefore plan for talks to discuss this matter either with the United States of America or with the NATO Alliance As we know antimissile defence is a subject of cooperation within NATO as well as within NATORussian Federation Council Member of the Commission Mr President I will be very brief today because the Commission has very little competence in this matter P But let me say that interaction between the United States of America Russia and the EU Member States in the areas of security and defence has wider implications for these important partnerships That is clear Therefore although as I said we really do not have competence or responsibility in this question we hope that a balanced solution can be found that is in the end satisfactory for all P We have welcomed from the very beginning the highlevel talks that started in Moscow last October followed by expert meetings And we see in the recent direct dialogue between Moscow and Warsaw an opportunity to clarify respective positions in respect of national sovereignty P In conclusion in whatever forum these issues are discussed be it NATO or be it the OSCE I think it would be important that decisions on the future of the European security architecture should also involve the European Union on behalf of the PPEDE Group DE Mr President ladies and gentlemen when we in Europe talk of antimissile defence the discussion normally revolves around the United States planned installations in Poland and the Czech Republic Many people are unaware that these are merely extensions to an existing system designed to protect the United States of America We in the European Parliament however must focus first and foremost on its implications for the security of the continent of Europe As we know the United States has already spent more than 100 billion dollars on its antimissile defence system and is investing a further ten billion a year in the continuing development of the system Yet the United States is much further away from potential sources of danger than we are in Europe The present situation is rather like Luxembourg spending money to build dykes but the Netherlands seeing no need to do likewise P We must ask ourselves whether a threat actually exists and if so whether we need to respond to it The debate we have just heard with Mr Solana shows that the situation in Iran remains a source of concern We are also aware of the threat that could emanate from the unstable situation in Pakistan P We in the Subcommittee on Security and Defence have engaged in intensive dialogue with representatives of the United States including Lieutenant General Henry Obering Director of the Missile Defense Agency It emerged clearly from these talks that the US system would be able in theory to protect part of Europe but not the whole continent In particular it could not protect Cyprus Malta parts of Greece Romania Bulgaria or southern Italy From a European point of view however we cannot tolerate a division of our continent into areas with differing degrees of security Accordingly we must jointly define our common European security interests in this context P The present appraisal reminds us that there is currently no forum in which this matter is being discussed and in which these common European security interests are being defined This is clearly another area where very close coordination with Russia is needed P We expect NATOs Bucharest summit in April to present proposals for a joint system and we expect these proposals to take due account of our specific European security interests on behalf of the PSE Group NL Mr President this is not the first time that we have discussed this issue it is also not the first time that we have had the same answers from the Council which says that it has no competence here as does the Commission although and I must congratulate the Commissioner for this she did say at the end that things need to be organised differently in the European Union P If something happens that affects the security of all Europeans and that comes under the security strategy that Mr Solana described to us we need to be able to talk to each other about it Parliament fortunately is able to talk about it This is an issue that concerns both the citizens and the Member States of the European Union so we feel it is entirely proper that it should be on the agenda P I do not intend to go back over all the objections that our Group has already voiced against this plan that the Americans have come up with What we think is wrong is that bilateral negotiations are going on with two NATO Member States which coincidentally or otherwise are also Member States of the European Union and this affects relations with Russia including the European Unions relations with it It is also wrong that the system is being developed unilaterally albeit within NATO and that it has not been clearly explained exactly why the system is necessary whether it will work and whether it is becoming too costly P There is an interesting debate going on in Poland at the moment where the new government has said that it may be prepared to cooperate on the system but that this is because it is what the Americans want and because it is Americas security at stake rather than Polands After all the system is actually more of a threat than an improvement to Polands security This is why the Poles are also asking for more help with developing air defences for the Polish army for example creating a sort of arms race P So it is interesting that the debate has restarted in Poland on whether the system is useful or necessary and that the new Polish prime minister or at least the Polish foreign minister has had the guts to talk to Russia about it We wholeheartedly support this P The situation is rather different in the Czech Republic where we have the impression that the system and the Czech contribution to it are being pushed through against the will of the people since I believe that 70 of Czechs are against the development of the system I therefore fear that there are moves afoot to push through decisions this year to conclude agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic before a new administration hopefully takes over in the United States We know that the democrats are fairly sceptical about developing the Air Missile System P In any event we hope that there will be a discussion in the Council and we urge that this issue be taken very seriously If it goes through it is bound to have an impact on our already difficult relationship with Russia The public are anxious What we have is a new arms race and there are a number of other things that we think the European Parliament simply has to speak out about We have done so in the past and we should carry on doing it P I think that our main role is to see whether this is necessary whether it is the start of a new arms race whether it really will improve security and whether it really will help us to combat the rogue states I am still not convinced that the Iranians will have the capacity to fire missiles as quickly as the Americans claim This is something else we have had contradictory information about So I hope that we can take the discussion forward on this issue here in Parliament and also monitor what is happening in the Czech Republic and Poland My Group remains opposed to the system on behalf of the ALDE Group FI Mr President the biggest threat to humanity is not the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries The real problem is the existence of nuclear weapons generally The only ethical and permanent option in our approach to antimissile defence systems and other nuclear weapons systems is to abandon their use The EU too should commit to new agreements controlling armament and be proactive in its attempt to initiate the disarmament process P Americas antimissile defence system would increase the risk of nuclear war The nuclear shield planned for Poland and the Czech Republic is based on the assumption that a nuclear war can be won The type of antimissile defence practised by the United States is radically different from its earlier deterrent policy because the aim of that was to prevent one country from taking its revenge on another The former deterrent effect of nuclear armament is thus out of the picture The balance of fear therefore disappears That is why an US antimissile system in Poland or the Czech Republic is a crucial matter of concern for the whole of Europe and all its Member States That being so it is important that the EU should debate the matter and make known the concerns of its citizens We should really also be considering here whether this will improve security in Europe and Europes defence or whether it will go the other way with the new system actually weakening security in Europe on behalf of the UEN Group LV Ladies and gentlemen at times President Putins rhetoric reminds us of the possibility of Russia aiming its missiles at Europe This proves that there is a certain strategic balance between the United States and Russia There is however no such balance between Europe and Russia Nor can this be ensured by Frances and Great Britains nuclear umbrellas I therefore believe it is right to ask how Europes rather than the United States joint missile defence can be ensured Are we discussing these issues only because the United States takes care of its own defence Mrs FerreroWaldner members of the Commission and the European Union are not even concerned about this form of defence Do you not think that it is only natural for the United States NATO and also certain Member States to decide on this together I believe that the European Union must formulate an unequivocal position that should then be executed together with NATO and the United States Otherwise we should not waste our time here because everything will be decided by NATO on behalf of the VertsALE Group FR Mr President Minister Commissioner I admit that that is undoubtedly the new European policy It reminds me of my son when he was four years old When you asked him Where are you he would put his hands over his eyes and say Im not here That is what the Commission is saying to us We are not here It has nothing to do with us or with Europe P DE I am sorry but that is absolute nonsense We have to decide now whether we want a common European foreign and security policy We even have a new treaty that gives us our own foreign minister with responsibility for a common foreign and security policy and when we have a common foreign minister we shall surely have to discuss matters at the European level not as individual governments discussing their countries security with other individual governments or like Mr von Wogau who maintains that Europe is threatened by Iran or goodness knows what other countries I do not share that view and at the very least we must discuss things at the European level We cannot simply say that the Americans have hit on some harebrained scheme that George Bush will no longer be in office six months from now so they might drop their harebrained scheme but we Europeans have nothing to do with all of this P We are highly sceptical about this whole antimissile defence strategy but we firmly believe it is something that we Europeans are dutybound to discuss It is not a decision for the Polish or Czech Members or for Members of any particular nationality Romanians and Bulgarians tomorrow Sicilians the next day or whatever No we have a common interest in taking decisions about our security That is essentially laid down in the Treaty that you have ratified and that we intend to ratify in the provisions on a common foreign and security policy Accordingly this issue must be a matter for the European Union The decision must not be taken bilaterally between Poland and the United States or between the Czech Republic and the United States It is a European decision It is a European problem and we must find a European solution on behalf of the GUENGL Group CS Ladies and gentlemen I am pleased that the issue of installing American antimissile defence tools in the Czech Republic and Poland ie on European Union territory is being dealt with by the European Parliament which is the most democratic institution given that it is directly elected by the citizens of the Union whom this issue affects P In this context I would like to stress that I am supported by my colleagues in the GUENGL Group and I also draw on my own experience as a military expert but most importantly I am supported by the majority of citizens in my country where 70 of the population are against the installation of the American radar system P The American antimissile defence is presented to us as a defence shield so why was the Czech Republic for example not allowed to sell the Tamara passive radar detection system without active military components to China The reason given was that China would gain an inadequate advantage in its relations with other countries Is this not a manipulation of words Is not the real issue of stationing the radar in the Czech Republic also about gaining advantage Even a layman can understand what warriors had known long before Hannibal a shield in a soldiers hand is a means for a better and more efficient use of his sword P The talk is about increased security but is the issue not really about increasing security risks It is only logical that we will immediately become target number one for potential adversaries We are told that we should oblige the US in order to prove that we are good allies Canada has not obliged either does that make it a bad US ally Is it not the case that Canada has perhaps learned a lesson from the purposebuilt justification for military action in Iraq P We are surprised at Russias reaction However given that the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty and acts in its own interest this reaction is not illogical Was the United States happy years ago about the close proximity of Soviet missiles in Cuba P There is no doubt that the US is a superpower and its views proposals and requests cannot be swept off the table just like that However if we are really concerned about greater security especially in Europe then the road to it follows a more complicated path via negotiations and agreements not unilateral steps This is the responsibility not only of the major players the US and Russia but of the European Union too CS There is huge proliferation of medium and mediumlong range carriers at the start of the 21st century Unfortunately in the absence of an international security regime the only way to stop it through effective defence P Effective defence is the paramount right of the EU Member States The SOFA negotiations that are currently taking place in Prague are a legitimate right of the Czech Republic Because the radar situated on Czech Republic territory will ensure the security of many European countries and because this will be the first opportunity for the Czech Republic a country that had been occupied for many years to actively contribute towards European security the Czech Government must be extremely responsible in its actions P The antimissile defence system must be trustworthy and defensive and must respect the indivisibility of security We thus welcome information about the Bucharest summit where a decision on the construction of a complementary LTBMD system should be made Moving negotiations to NATO guarantees implementation of indivisibility Making it clear that this is a purely defensive system is the subject of AmericanPolishCzechRussian negotiations P My final point concerns effectiveness Taking into account what we know about Irans November tests we must realise that we have a common responsibility We must not ruin the effectiveness of our common defence with quarrels over whether we should defend ourselves at all CS Allow me to make use of this oneminute speech to call on the Council of the European Union and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy to discuss the American antimissile defence system at European level P The installation of the American antimissile defence system in Europe is a panEuropean issue It is not just a matter for Czechs Poles or Americans IntraEuropean Union relations EUNATO relations EUUS relations and EURussia relations are all at stake I would therefore ask that this issue be included in the Councils agenda P As far as the Czech Republic is concerned I would like to mention one fact 70 of the citizens of the Czech Republic are opposed to this system Three quarters of the citizens of the Czech Republic want a referendum on the subject The Czech Government does not communicate with the public the Czech Government does not inform the Members of the Czech Parliament the Czech Government does everything behind the backs of the Czech people It is important to know this and it must be highlighted in the Council of the European Union PL Mr President may I first remind everyone that the missile defence shield is not only an issue for Poland and the Czech Republic it concerns the United Kingdom and Denmark too since facilities in both those countries are also to be included in the system So let us not talk only about Poland or the Czech Republic P The second point is that the missile defence shield and the installations that form part of it will not be a magnet for terrorists Terrorists strike at soft targets not welldefended military bases P Finally a third point The European Union is not a military ally Perhaps it is pity that it isnt but that is the fact of the matter and the new treaty the Treaty of Lisbon changes nothing in that respect That being so a defence issue is either NATOs responsibility or the responsibility of countries that have not decided to join an alliance and wish to defend themselves separately Obviously there has to be a discussion in NATO about how this system should fit into other systems that NATO intends to develop That is absolutely essential Let us not forget that 21 countries in the European Union are members of NATO DE Mr President one of the supreme antiwar novels is about the good soldier Schweik by Jaroslav Hašek The position adopted by the Commission and the Council however outshines Schweik it outdoes Franz Kafka too and it even outdoes any ostrich We cannot pursue this headinthesand policy We must discuss this issue among ourselves on the floor of the European Parliament but we must also discuss it of course with the members of NATO We must discuss it with the Czechs the Poles and the Russians This is an essential process that must be conducted on a panEuropean scale DE Mr President the technical function of the planned antimissile system is to take out a potential enemys secondstrike capability of that there is no doubt In other words it is also an attack system This must be taken into account in the debate Whether the missile system is set up by the United States by NATO together with the United States or by any other combination it remains an arms programme The salient point for me is that the European Union is unable to come up with a common position on the issue In this matter the common foreign and security policy of the European Union is being exposed to ridicule Mr CohnBendit can cite the Reform Treaty until the cows come home as long as the present situation continues and no common position is adopted at all the Union will simply make itself a laughing stock P What we must do is to say clearly that we do not want this antimissile system The fact is that a very clear majority of this European Parliament says No to this system In the countries of Europe including the Czech Republic public opinion is firmly opposed to the antimissile system and of course the Polish Government has undoubtedly refined its previous position For these reasons I would welcome our adoption of a resolution in which the House clearly rejects this missile system CS Allow me to thank the Council represented by the Slovenian Presidency and the Commission represented by Commissioner FerreroWaldner for adhering fairly strictly to the tone of the European Treaties According to the Treaties these issues are entirely the responsibility of the nation states I should mention that even the new Lisbon Treaty explicitly states that issues of national security are the competence of the individual EU Member States alone P I am convinced that European security is indivisibly linked to the security of the entire EuroAtlantic region and in a situation where the European Union is incapable of protecting its members from new risks be they financial or technological this link becomes vital P Regarding public opinion which has been mentioned here several times I can only add that those who refer to opinion polls and call for a referendum are often the same people who opposed a referendum on another very important issue namely the new European Treaty CS Ladies and gentlemen allow me to sum up all the arguments P Essentially this issue is not only about increasing the security of the Czech Republic and Poland but in fact increasing the security of the whole of Europe The negotiations on the positioning of such a system are the responsibility of the nation state as such Similar systems exist in other countries in Member States of the European Union P Todays speakers have clearly emphasised that there is a real danger We need to realise that when it comes to the issue of security decisions must be made very quickly Such decisions can also have a preventive element Only if we are ready and strong can we force aggressors to negotiate and to adhere to security requirements P To conclude I would like to say that I completely reject the view that the Czech Government has not communicated with its citizens about this system An information campaign has been under way for several months CS I would like to make four points concerning this topic P The first relates to the Founding Act between NATO and the Russian Federation of May 1997 In this Act both sides pledged jointly to eliminate the use of force and even the threat of force in the continent of Europe If this Act is valid then in fact it rules out the possibility of a situation such as the one we have been discussing here arising in our continent P The second point concerns the Helsinki Process The signatories to the Accords to the Declaration pledged in Helsinki to reduce the presence of military systems in Europe This action would reverse the trend In my opinion the reduction in the number of military systems in the European continent should continue P The third point concerns the number of bases There are American bases in 18 European countries If we include the new ones the total would rise to 20 We would thus be confirming Zbigniew Brzezińskis words that the European Union is a de facto American protectorate P The fourth point concerns the purpose of the whole system I think it is sufficiently clear to ensure intelligence coverage and intelligence control over the whole continent of Europe PL Madam President Prime Minister Tusk is sensitive to the arguments of his European neighbours Polands possible participation in this American project must not become a source of misunderstanding within the Union itself The new Polish government values good relations with the United States but knows Poland is above all a member of the European family P Poland is also paying heed to Russias reservations and reacting calmly despite the harsh tone adopted by some representatives of the Russian armed forces At the present time when the European Union does not have a common foreign and security policy Polands final decision as to the stationing of elements of the missile defence shield on its territory will be its sovereign decision Poland appreciates different opinions and does not resent criticism P Ladies and gentlemen we ask you to respect our position which must first and foremost guarantee the security of our own citizens P Applause PresidentinOffice SL I would like to thank Mr CohnBendit for reminding us of the fact that yesterday Slovenia was the second Member State to ratify the new Treaty of Lisbon However the Treaty is not in force yet As we know we need 24 more countries to ratify it and the Presidency of Slovenia is hoping that the States will ratify it on time and that the new Treaty of Lisbon will come into force by the planned deadline P I would like to stress that it will not bring major changes or anything new in terms of the basic premises on which European security and defence policies are founded In particular it will not change the fact that this policy is based on national competence which the Member States retain in the domain of national security and defence P The European Union already has a European security and defence policy which already provides a framework for such discussions within the Council as well Alternatively such discussions will take place within the framework of the Council but that will not depend so much on the Presidency as on the will and interest of the Member States Let me assure you that the Council will be informed in detail about todays debate and the viewpoints expressed in it The debate is closed",

afternoon there is to be a discussion on the Lamfalussy process I have heard that Mr McCreevy will be unable to attend We must accept that The Commission is a collegial body and any Commissioner can stand in for any other I have a high regard for Mrs Fischer Boel as a Commissioner but would it not be possible in this case to ask Mr Almunia who is more familiar with the material to represent the Commission P Mr President I believe you have had word that Commissioner Frattini will no longer perform his function as a Commissioner with effect from 14 March We observe a certain disparity between the Frattini case and that of Louis Michel who ceased to perform the duties of his office from the day on which he became an election candidate Perhaps Mr President you can ask the Commission to inform us why this distinction has been made and to explain why in one case the Commissioner in question ceased to perform his duties on the day he became a candidate whereas in another case the Commissioner will not relinquish his duties until about a week after his nomination That is the request I make on behalf of my group I believe there are no objections to the first request namely that Commissioner Almunia present the Commissions views in that debate As for the second request we shall look into that P Wednesday P No amendments P Thursday P We have received several requests for the debates on breaches of human rights P The PPEDE Group has moved that the second item on Afghanistan be replaced by a new item entitled Arrests of demonstrators following the presidential elections in Russia DE Mr President this is not an item about the Russian elections themselves but about the fact that in the immediate aftermath of the Russian elections demonstrations were broken up by OMON security forces and 50 people were arrested most of whom are still in custody That was a brutal act of aggression and we take the view that it demands an instant reaction from this Parliament DE Mr President we discussed this at last Thursdays meeting of the Conference of Presidents I do not believe it serves any purpose to discuss this matter now in isolation In the nottoodistant future in the runup to the EURussia summit we shall have the opportunity to debate the overall state of relations between the EU and Russia This item could be incorporated into that debate Accordingly we have recommended that instead of consigning it to Thursday afternoon when only 25 Members are present we should deal with it as part of the major debate that we already intend to hold P The delegation from our Parliament is due to visit Russia in a few days time We should await their return and listen to what they have to report P Parliament approved the request FR Mr President what has just happened and has made some of my fellow Members laugh is very serious Mr Daul we are talking about a young man of 23 sentenced to death for downloading an article on the rights of women in Islam in a country that has close ties with the European Union where our soldiers are defending Afghanistan with a new constitution that officially defends fundamental rights and freedom of expression With one voice you have just taken on a responsibility that I hope you will not come sorely to regret P Applause Let me make the following proposal Mr Wurtz I have already written to the President of Afghanistan about this matter and if you are all in agreement I shall take the initiative again not just in my own name but on behalf of the whole House May I assume that this is what everyone wants In that case we shall not immerse ourselves any further in this matter Mr CohnBendit and I shall launch another initiative on behalf of you all P I would really like to avoid a debate If Mr Schulz wishes to speak Mr CohnBendit is entitled to address us first P Does Mr CohnBendit wish to speak That is the proper procedure but I shall not give anyone preferential treatment P Mr CohnBendit does not wish to make a statement What about Mr Schulz DE Mr President I do not intend to make a statement I should just like to say that I fully share the views expressed by Francis Wurtz The decision we took in the Conference of Presidents last Thursday was based in part on the point he has just made May I now ask you to let us avail ourselves of the possibility of adding this item to Thursdays agenda We now have other matters that we can put on the agenda Since I just made an exception for Mr Schulz I must let Mr Posselt speak again but please do not let this discussion drag on any further DE Mr President I would like to endorse what Mr Schulz and Mr Wurtz have said Our purpose was not to prevent the House from addressing another issue but to put Russia on the agenda P I would appeal to the chairs of the two main political groups to let us return to the old arrangement whereby we could deal with up to five topics The restriction to three items was a mistake and that is the source of these difficulties I must inform those Members who do not yet know about the other requests for inclusion in the agenda that the ALDE and GUE Groups have tabled a joint request for the inclusion of a new item dealing with the case of the Iranian Mehdi Kazemi I believe that is also a very urgent matter P In addition the PPEDE Group has also requested that the case of Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho be placed on the agenda P I must brief you on the subject of formal requests We can now vote again on whether to put the case of the Afghan on the agenda but if that request were approved it would definitely rule out a vote on the other two topics I have to make you aware of that DE Mr President Mr Schulz requested that this topic be added to the agenda as an extra item If that is not possible I regret to say we shall have to vote against it We would like to put the Iraqi bishop on the agenda as well as supporting Mr Schulzs request That after all is what he himself was proposing We already have two items on the agenda A third item may be added It can be this one but it could also be either of the two others that have been requested We have agreed on two items and three more requests are on the table Under our Rules of Procedure we can only put three items on our agenda which means that we have to choose between the case in Afghanistan the Iranian case and the Archbishop We are bound by that rule P This is why I asked you whether you were in agreement with the procedure of voting first on the Afghan case If that request is approved by a majority the other two will lapse I have to inform you properly of the procedural consequences Mr President I do not see the logic in taking one of them before any of the others because they are all different they are all cases which have great merits on their own My group together with the GUENGL Group has proposed that we have a debate on the Iranian homosexual in mortal danger and I would like to find a way of dealing with this P I fear that this is what happens when groups do not coordinate and start acting out of order We made a clear decision on Russia at the Conference of Presidents last week If the cooperation and there is a lot of it between the PPEDE Group and the PSE Group cannot manage this in such a way that we do not end up in this mess then I think the two groups ought to be looking at it I think you have got to find a fair way Mr President of dealing with these three together It is indeed a difficult business because we can only have three items It would also be possible however to regard the Afghan and Iranian cases as a single issue of individuals facing the threat of death This would leave only one case uncovered namely that of the Archbishop which could be addressed in another item That I believe would certainly be a reasonable approach DE Mr President we shall make an exception and support that proposal Let me also say to Mr Posselt that his groups request explicitly stated instead of Afghanistan Rather than trying to talk ones way out of a tight corner at this stage it would be better to consider the implications of requests before tabling them but in this case Mr President we can support your compromise I do not see any contradiction there and in the matter of the Archbishop we can choose a procedure through the President of Parliament which also devotes due attention to his cause without our making it an item in the topical and urgent debate P Parliament approved the Presidents proposal P The order of business was thus established",

    "input": "Common rules in the field of civil aviation security debate The next item is the report by Paolo Costa on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation EC No 23202002 rapporteur IT Mr President VicePresident of the Commission ladies and gentlemen we are today celebrating the conclusion of a procedure that started as far back as September 2005 P The road that we have travelled has been long and in some cases difficult but ultimately I feel that it was worth the effort The issue at stake is the security of civil aviation The regulation that we had in force that has been in force up to now was adopted in the emotional climate surrounding the attacks on the Twin Towers on 11 September 2001 It had a difficult birth but was then approved and applied and while it has had some success in recent years there have been practical gaps and inadequacies P It is for that reason that we are now about to revise it The aim is to provide a more flexible response to technological psychological and behavioural changes in the fight against terrorism obviously taking account of the experience that we have gained up to now Security and protection from terrorist attacks are an obvious priority but cannot be discussed in isolation They have to be seen in a slightly more balanced context P Checks have to be stringent and efficient but should not overly inconvenience passengers and their application should not entail unnecessary costs Costs should possibly be shared and should not be borne entirely by passengers It is for that reason that new checks cannot be introduced without adequate democratic scrutiny It is on those two points costs and democratic accountability that Parliaments delegation focused its attention during the conciliation stage of this procedure P As regards costs I am happy to be able to inform this House that an article not a recital has been included to lay down that they security costs must be shared between passengers airports air carriers and national governments Under a further article not an interinstitutional declaration as in 2002 but an article the Commission is to examine the problem in more detail and to put proposals before this House and the Council in order to resolve the problem through an appropriate sharing of costs between taxpayers and passengers P As regards democratic accountability we successfully managed to achieve the use of enhanced comitology or comitology with scrutiny especially when any new check control or limitation on passengers lives is introduced Were Parliament to decide in future that a security measure is disproportionate it will be able to call for a public debate in order adequately to examine such considerations P Overall I feel that the balance between an effective fight against terrorism and at the same time respect which is as broad as possible for privacy practices and pointless irritations for passengers has in this way been achieved Obviously only actual testing of its application will tell us whether this has been fully achieved P It is for that reason Mr President that I would recommend to the Chamber to our House that it approves the agreement reached in conciliation so that the Commission can make an effective start on its work VicePresident of the Commission FR Mr President ladies and gentlemen you have before you a proposal for a new framework regulation on aviation security with which you are all familiar I appreciate all the work and effort you have put in to achieve a positive outcome in a long and difficult conciliation procedure P We have now come to the final stage for a new framework regulation further evidence of better regulation On 4 March the Council formally completed the third reading of this balanced and beneficial text which is important for both the industry and for passengers It is now up to members of the European Parliament to conclude the process P I am grateful to Mr Costa for asking Parliament to agree with the text and thus ensuring a successful outcome for the conciliation Everyone has shown a spirit of compromise in the conciliation process but I think I can say that Parliament came out the winner because most of the amendments and ideas suggested are in the text on which you will be voting P I understood your expectations regarding the financing principle I made a very strong personal commitment in the conciliation process With your permission I refer to my previous statement that I intended to submit a draft legislative proposal to the Commission on the division between taxpayers and users of the costs arising from the stricter aviation security measures the Member States can adopt in addition to the basic rules laid down in this new regulation P That does not prejudice the right of initiative of the Commission or compliance with domestic procedures in particular conducting an appropriate impact study before any legislative proposal P Furthermore with the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny the change to the new comitology decision will give the European Parliament greater power over the general rules the Commission has to draw up after the adoption of the framework regulation P Whilst allowing more flexibility in the system for adapting the legislation in the regulatory procedure with scrutiny all this provides a counterbalance in the general implementing legislation Thus we are making institutional progress in all these situations P As regards Article 4 I draw your attention to the statement made The Commission is declaring its intention of proposing general measures as indicated in the current Article 41a and detailed implementing measures within the meaning of the current Article 42 The Commission intends to use Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to propose any additions that are needed to the common basic standards laid down in this regulation P The Commission notes that it is important to allow detailed implementing measures to be devised by methods that can not only ensure effective detection and deterrence but also provide the necessary flexibility and speed whilst at the same time keeping sensitive documents confidential in order to protect passengers The Commission also points out that the continuity of the implementing rules will be maintained until they are replaced by new measures adopted under this regulation P As for the substance the new regulation allows the development of more appropriate legislation that is better able to address security issues holistically and flexibly rather than dealing with them through a series of individual and repetitive approaches Initial estimates by the Association of European Airlines suggest that the more flexible methods can reduce costs by up to 500 million P To summarise when this new regulation is adopted it will make it easier to adopt rules with nonmember countries that have equally high air security standards This onestop security concept is in the interests not only of passengers but also of the European Union aviation sector P Besides that I hope that the latest technological developments will enable us to amend the total ban on liquids on board aircraft by the beginning of next year As soon as the appropriate technology is available to detect liquid explosives I shall endeavour to take that new factor into account in the regulations The European Parliament will be able to review any plans for a change of rules in that area P Ladies and gentlemen this has been a lengthy process It has taken a great deal of effort by everyone to arrive at the compromise needed for the adoption of this new regulation Not only will this new regulation help us improve security in the air it will also reduce costs simplify the rules and protect civil aviation more effectively P So I thank Parliament for its work on drawing up this legislative proposal and I am obviously hoping wholeheartedly for your support and adoption of the text on behalf of the PPEDE Group Mr President as both the rapporteur and Commissioner Barrot have said following long negotiations in the conciliation process Parliament and the Council have finally reached an agreement which I believe to be positive and worthy of our support P In the light of the ongoing terrorist threat we believe that clear rules for security and importantly common implementation across Europes airports and airlines are absolutely necessary and this proposal delivers on both counts P Whilst we have been unable to reach an agreement with the Council on the issue of financing these security measures the Commission has agreed to come forward with a separate proposal on financing these measures within the next few months I hope that this will be sooner rather than later P I want to make it clear here and now that when coming forward with this proposal both the Council and the Commission should take heed of Parliaments strong and united position on the issue Parliament must not be seen as another hoop that the Commission and the Council must jump through but instead as a serious and equal player in the process Passenger safety and security are of paramount importance and as such I hope that the Commissions forthcoming proposal will reflect our strong stance P Despite this sticking point this report should be applauded I can see the benefits in common security standards across Europe And given that the heightened terrorist threat to aviation today is one which is ever growing this proposal offers important improvements for passenger safety and security I therefore urge the House to give this measure its full support on behalf of the PSE Group NL Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the terrorist attacks of 911 and other subsequent threats have made us realise how vulnerable the aviation sector is and how deadly the effects of an attack using an aircraft or perpetrated inside one can be And what an enormous impact those effects can have on the economy and thus on each and every one of us Consequently it is important that we do everything necessary to ensure maximum security and it goes without saying that we must have maximum harmonisation on the matter at European level P But at the same time we must also seek a balance between security on the one hand and comfort privacy and freedom of movement on the other hand as the rapporteur says That was always our view as the European Parliaments delegation during the negotiations and I think we worked well together across party lines with Mr Costa Mr Jarzembowski in the conciliation procedure too We all pulled together and we came out of it with a good compromise deal as the Commissioner rightly points out P That is not to say that we are one hundred percent happy Everything will depend on how the agreements reached are implemented on the ground And in two essential areas firstly implementation of the measures We have secured a significant continuing involvement for Parliament via the new comitology procedure with scrutiny and we have de facto obtained a kind of veto for cases where we think the proposed measures are disproportionate So there is room for interpretation for debate and I think the liquids ban made it clear that this is necessary We cannot allow a committee of experts to have carte blanche and not be accountable and so to me this new form of democratic scrutiny is altogether a plus point P We can perfectly well take on that job if the Commission keeps us continuously informed and briefed and I think this will be something very important We must also devise the right procedure inhouse which will enable Parliament to do this adequately P Secondly we did not quite get what we wanted as regards the financing of security measures we know that We wanted to remain consistent in our thinking Our expectation is that the security measures agreed by Europe will be adequate for everyone If Member States need or want to do more then they should bear the cost of that We did not manage to get that accepted but I am sure Commissioner that the undertaking you have given will lead to a new debate and genuine results in future P In any event as of today we have a framework that should allow us to take security measures quickly but will at the same time provide democratic accountability It remains to be seen whether the system works to everyones satisfaction My Group too will support this on behalf of the ALDE Group NL To be blunt there is no doubt that aviation is and remains a popular target for terrorists So the need for stricter security rules for air transport with the extra cost and burdens that entails is immediately obvious But when it comes to maintaining the basic framework for this it is truly essential that the measures in place should be effective In that respect this agreement whilst not perfect nevertheless represents an important step forward P Regarding the enhanced role of Parliament I very much hope we shall make full use of this More than ever we need to apply a measure of realism to assumptions concerning the effectiveness of our laws and rules It is of course important that collective stress should be properly managed At the same time the air traveller does have to be taken seriously Costly but sham security does no one any favours P Terrorists are getting more and more ingenious The answer is not to confiscate bottles of water shower gels or contact lens fluid The solution lies in the efficient operation across borders of police justice and intelligence services I look forward accordingly to the phased plan which the Commissioner has just described The importance of aviation safety should not and ought not to be ignored and I am full of praise for the work that has been done to bring about this solution which ensures the safety of air passengers and workers P When we draft and implement these types of regulations we need to be careful that these regulations arent regulations for the sake of regulations and that we consider other aspects of the aviation sector as well On that basis I welcome the provision in the Report which states that certain passengers those who come from countries which have identical safety measures as the Union need not go through extra security checks It is a great pity that the same approach is not taken with regard to dutyfree goods and transit passengers P As it stands if a person comes from the United States to Ireland and changes planes in Paris any dutyfree goods bought in the United States will be taken from that person in Paris This nonsensical system means that passengers and retailers are loosing out P I agree that security concerns are a priority However the solution that was agreed in Singapore shows that the two things can be done Why is it then that those arrangements cannot be made with other countries We know that there are plans being made but it is happening too slowly for passengers and retailers who have to bear the consequences on behalf of the VertsALE Group DE Mr President this has been a very longrunning saga and I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Costa In the negotiations including those with the Council he remained steadfastly committed to the position formulated and supported by the Members of this House in committee P One of the points at issue as has been mentioned was the funding of security measures the reason why is fairly obvious For example these security measures lend themselves very well to the concealment of what would be less than entirely legal funding arrangements for the various national airlines I presume this is precisely why there were all sorts of resistance in the Council to a set of rules that imposed greater transparency in this area and of course it was our Groups clear and unanimous desire to have transparent straightforward funding provisions that were designed to help preclude problems P The second point was the arrangement whereby Parliament was to be more closely involved in the continuing development of the security provisions This was fiercely resisted too although I could not comprehend why because the European Parliament after all had only tried to indicate an escape route that could be used for example to get out of measures that had once been adopted but had subsequently begun to prove inexpedient I can just about support the compromise but I would have wished for more on behalf of the GUENGL Group CS The European Parliament and the European Commission have been debating aviation security for several years P The purpose of the amendment to Regulation EC No 23202002 of 16 December 2002 is to ensure an improvement of the common rules in the field of civil aviation security The resulting document however is not very clear So that not only myself but also many other Members of this Parliament can raise their hands in favour of the result of the conciliation procedure I want to hear a clear answer to my question P Commissioner Monsieur le Commissaire cest pour vous since the new Regulation does not guarantee a common procedure for testing pilot safety how will this issue be solved once Regulation EC No 23202002 is abolished Can you confirm that the European Cockpit Association and the Commission have agreed on the preparation of a regulation establishing a common procedure for testing pilot safety If yes when will this text be presented Your answer will determine how we will vote tomorrow EL Mr President let me begin by expressing my deep satisfaction with the agreement that has at last been reached on the amendment to the Regulation establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security I should like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Costa on his work as well as the representatives of the political groups Mr Jarzembowski and Mr El Khadraoui who together with our rapporteur formed the core of our negotiating group Armed with their detailed knowledge of the subject and its technical dimensions and with their unwavering dedication to the European Parliaments position on transparency and respect for citizens they have fought hard and unrelentingly to achieve this objective I should also like to thank all the members of the European Parliament Delegation of which I had the honour of chairing for their cooperation at all stages and especially at critical moments Let me commend the Portuguese Presidencys continuing efforts to achieve mutual understanding and agreement I should also like to single out the European Commissions constructive and decisive contribution to which Commissioner Barrot contributed so much P The new regulation is not merely the result of successful negotiation In the final analysis it represents a shared view of the relationship between security on the one hand and private citizens and our political objectives on the other The new regulation is the fruit of the experience we have gained through applying the security rules It is a better expression of the need for transparency and responsibility on the part of all the agencies involved It provides an effective framework for the safe movement of passengers in a globalised environment while enabling Member States to adapt their policy to new developments and the special needs that may arise during a particular period The regulation also requires Member States to maintain transparency and bear part of the cost vital conditions according to the European Parliament P As well as the Member States having to honour these obligations the European Commission has undertaken to draw up a report at the end of 2008 which will contribute enormously to this endeavour The European Parliament will then prepare to play an effective role in enforcing the necessary measures ROI would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Costa and all colleagues that took part in the negotiations relating to the third reading We are discussing this document after more than two years from the regulation being proposed by the Commission in 2005 with a view to replacing the regulation of 2002 adopted following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 P Air transport has experienced an accelerated development over the last years If in 1970 there were approximately 200 million passengers in the EU15 in 2000 their number reached approximately 600 million Unfortunately the terrorist attacks of 11 September caused a decrease between 2000 and 2001 of approximately 2 in the number of passengers using air transport P The European Parliament believes that the safety of passengers and of the personnel working in the field of air transport is highly important The debates as part of the conciliation procedure mainly focused on the distribution of costs related to the necessary security measures the uniform performance of security inspections the impact of certain programmes for the safety of civil aviation adopted at national airport or air carrier level Common security standards should subsequently be adopted using the regulatory procedure with scrutiny so that the European Parliament will have an important role in this process The costs related to the additional measures for civil aviation safety should be incurred both by Member States and users P By 31 December 2008 the Commission will submit to the European Parliament a report presenting the measures to be imposed so that taxes related to the security measures be used only for this purpose and the required transparency on the calculation and use of such taxes will be provided P As regards the use of security officers on board aircrafts each Member State has the competence to decide on the registered and authorised aircraft in the Member State in question but their role was improved by the enforcement of certain provisions on the training and security terms imposed thereon PL Madam President air transport needs defined legal rules but they must be as flexible as possible and at the same time sufficiently harmonised especially with regard to flight security The document we are discussing today meets those criteria It is in my view a difficult but good compromise by the members of the Conciliation Committee and I thank them for the work they have done In this connection Mr Costa and Commissioner Barrot deserve special praise P Since time is short I shall confine myself to a few points First charges for air security must be transparent and relate only to actual cost Second measures taken in this area must not interfere with competition among airports and carriers which is natural to the free market Third the principles governing civil aviation security need to be standardised at world level It is therefore to be welcomed that the document refers to cooperation with the International Civil Aviation Organisation the ICAO Fourth security standards must also be met by thirdcountry carriers otherwise our European measures will be ineffective Fifth suitable procedures must be prepared for dealing with crisis situations which may never arise but are always possible in the event of a terrorist attack P Finally let us jointly strive to make the passenger including disabled passengers the subject rather than the object of the action taken by all parties involved in air transport especially when it comes to security measures which involve a degree of inconvenience Madam President I am pleased to see that progress has been made on this issue because Parliament has always indicated that we should be very thorough on these measures improving security for air passengers I want to applaud Mr Costa my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and especially Commissioner Barrot who has worked to ensure that the arrangements for financing the measures are properly set out and that comitology is used to scrutinise the definition of common basic standards P EU cooperation is needed to provide consistency on this so that passengers are better informed As I said late last year mutual recognition of our differing legal traditions is the way forward in an EU of 27 Member States but basic security standards should be established in the EU When the Commission outlines the principle of financing later this year I will argue strongly that Member States should be allowed to go above and beyond these should they feel the need as long as they are prepared to pay the costs P This comes on the back of reports which claim that the British Airports Authority is to fingerprint and photograph all passengers checking in for domestic flights at Heathrow and several other airports I believe these measures should be scrutinised to make sure they are effective The use of biometric technology as proposed by Commissioner Frattini is in order to produce greater efficiency and must not alienate public support P The public have already tolerated a massive amount of inconvenience through security measures which may be desirable but there appears to be a lack of clear objective analysis of their effectiveness The random nature of some of the provisions is particularly disruptive and we should surely be asking for consistency in the approach of airport authorities across Europe if not on a global basis P The EU should be proactive rather than reactive with regard to all these security issues We must be one step ahead of the threat by developing more sophisticated technology and by sharing best practice and pooling intelligence I believe that this report certainly takes us somewhat in that direction ES Madam President we are extremely pleased to reach the end of what has proved to be a protracted battle to achieve better security in a core sector such as aviation which is essential to the economy and competitiveness of Europe and of which the success and credibility are rooted in a high level of security P This was demonstrated in the starkest way possible on 11 September 2001 when security itself was one of the key aspects which was shown to need improvement both on a global scale and particularly with reference to the European zone P All the efforts made by the Commission not only in this dossier but in others that the Commission has worked on the whole issue of blacklists and of gradually improving and implementing security measures are I believe essential P We particularly congratulate the rapporteur Mr Costa whose tenacity although exasperating at times has achieved an agreement a matter on which I congratulate him from the heart The best agreement possible P Moreover that agreement is on two fundamental topics First a topic fundamental to the absolute requirement of security and more specifically the crucial aspect of funding it We all agree that security is very important but another key aspect is who pays for that security and how we try to improve transparency and a better distribution of costs To that end I believe that the cooperation received from the Commission in proposing the study for the precise purpose of identifying and improving transparency in the costsharing between taxpayers and users will help us improve future measures and implement them P Secondly a topic fundamental to Parliament as an institution From the institutional point of view Mr Costa has managed to increase comitology in relation to methods of scanning and I believe that in future this too will put right a few misunderstandings which have arisen in the past for example in relation to liquids this is another area where I believe we must improve For the future we hope to complete all the key security dossiers for the aviation sector having regard to the key factor namely the human factor P I hope also that the Commissioner will be able to update us on how things are going with the schedule for the social package both for cabin crew and for pilots as far as training and certification are concerned We are aware that the EASA is working on this area but would like to see a greater number of specific measures on this matter which will be the central factor in this increase in security DE Madam President Mr VicePresident passenger security is a fundamental principle but how is it actually protected As top Italian football coach Giovanni Trapattoni would probably put it Belts off bottles empty shoes off Do these measures actually secure anything other than additional jobs for poorly paid and poorly trained security staff Besides long queues at airports hassle and economic disadvantages are once more being associated with Europe even though in many cases these annoyances are the result of exercises in diligence on the part of bumpedup local and regional sheriffs Surely we can do better than that P Let us revise the implementing provisions on liquids as quickly as possible and let us replace them with more and better technology and with better cooperation between the security services FR Madam President Commissioner I should like in particular to draw attention to the technological modernisation that is necessary to avoid the collapse of civil aviation My plea is for progress to be made in the CESAR project to promote technological innovation in aviation and make sure that civil aviation is no longer held hostage by certain forces on the ground I should like to ask what progress has been made in the Member States on transfers of rights Would that not have a great many benefits for passenger safety protection of the environment and aviation as a whole VicePresident of the Commission FR Madam President ladies and gentlemen I have listened carefully to your speeches As you have all underlined the challenge with our air security policy is to find a reasonable balance between the need to protect passengers against terrorist activity and of course the operational aspects at airports in order to avoid overcomplicated checking procedures The Commission proposal was aimed at significantly improving the chances of striking a reasonable balance As I said before the adoption of this regulation will enable us to establish more modern and flexible rules using new checking technologies to introduce the onestop security concept for flights from nonmember countries with a high standard of security to abolish certain duplicated requirements to codify the participation of stakeholders in decisionmaking on the implementing measures and of course to involve the European Parliament more in the process of decisionmaking on the implementing rules I personally undertake to launch initiatives in all areas of security funding in order to improve the current situation ensure greater transparency and make the financial commitment of the Member States more visible P So as I said I shall reply to some of your comments although I am not claiming that I will answer them all P The general rule the Commission will follow in future is to publicise all applications of the regulation unless it is shown that awareness of the regulation might aid terrorists That is very different from the present situation in which the default rule is not to publish anything That point is very important because it means that Parliament can be fully informed P So I shall reply to a few points In answer to Mr Ó Neachtain for me the dutyfree issue is still important We have drawn up a regulation that allows for derogations Through negotiation with Singapore we have managed to introduce this rule for all dealings with Singapore and we are now continuing with a number of nonmember countries in preparation for further derogations Obviously though these nonmember countries have to cooperate much more actively with us and we are letting them know of our interest in that The Americans and Canadians are working with us but it is absolutely vital and believe me this is something I personally am very concerned about for us to sign many more agreements with nonmember countries if we are to make any progress on the dutyfree issue P Mr Kohlíček and Mrs Ayala Sender mentioned pilots and crew We are working with the pilots Consultation is under way but I cannot prejudge its outcome What is true is that we are paying close attention to the problems to which we need to find the right solutions P It is true that as has rightly been said we need a very coherent approach at European level I am obviously keeping a close watch myself on how the regulations are applied and it is true that as Mr Kirkhope pointed out just now we clearly have to harmonise the rules and procedures for their implementation as well We also have to guard against some Member States taking initiatives that are more or less improvised and unilateral It is not easy we know the battle for funding of security measures and more transparent and balanced financing will be hard Mr Costa has experience of that I should also like to express my thanks to Mrs KratsaTsagaropoulou who chaired the Parliament delegation and was a great help to us during the long and very difficult meetings P Finally I should like to say something to Mr Costa because his report and his work as rapporteur gave us a real feeling that Parliament was genuinely seeking the common good of Europe the welfare of passengers and also of course a system of protection that is effective but at the same time flexible enough to allow for changes As I said earlier we are keeping a close eye on the new technologies that will I hope enable us to simplify these procedures The detection of explosives in liquids seems now to be well on the way I hope we shall be able to make use of those technologies They will obviously be welcome P I thank you Madam President and I thank Parliament in particular for the high standard of this debate and all the contributions it has made in the course of the debate rapporteur IT Madam President Commissioner ladies and gentlemen the regulation is a framework regulation and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating when it is applied As matters stand we have merely compared recipes P I believe that we are both aware that there are still two major problems The first is that the problem of terrorism has heightened security and the problem of terrorism cannot be considered a matter for the individual Imagining that every passenger has to be responsible for financing counterterrorism activities is an idea that obviously does not work Passengers are jointly responsible and it is that line that should to some extent sooner or later come to the fore and make states more responsible for such activities P The second is that unfortunately terrorism is forcing us to change the way we behave We must not so to speak shirk the task of introducing rules which place limits on each of our activities because the terrorists cannot be allowed to win out but we must at the same time make every effort to ensure that we do not little by little help terrorism to win because terrorism is forcing us to change the way we live P This is a difficult balance We have fielded all the possible arms codecision enhanced comitology simple comitology Those are all the tools we need We have much work to do in that direction but I think that a good foundation has been laid The debate is closed P The vote will take place on Tuesday 11 March 2008 P Written statements Rule 142 in writing RO The harmonisation of actions taken by Member States airports and airlines concerning the provision of civil aviation security represents an imperative requirement in order to deal with terrorist threats P Nevertheless a balance must be established between the enhancement of security and the provision of comfort to the users of air transport services P It is mandatory to take all necessary measures to enhance the technical performances of screening equipment as well as to apply a single check in the case of transit flights which would enable a reduction of processing time and in the mid to longterm the effective decrease of actual costs P On the other hand the lack of transparency in the calculation and application of taxes related to security measures distorts the competence in the field of air transport as well as understanding of the way in which the money is used in the direct financing of such measures P The issues related to financing must be clarified as soon as possible so that taxpayers in the European Union as well as the users of transport services have a clear picture about the allocation of amounts collected thus dissociating the financing of direct measures from the insurance costs as well as from any state aid in support of additional security measures that a Member State may enact",
